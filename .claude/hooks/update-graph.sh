# contributor no signal that graph auto-rebuild isn't active (issue #2074).
# Prefer the project's own local build over a global `codegraph` on PATH
# (issue #2134): a global binary can be a different, potentially older,
# version than the one actually checked out here, and building with it
# silently downgrades this project's build_meta / parsing results. Only
# fall back to the global binary when the project has no local build at all.
# docs/examples/claude-code-hooks/update-graph.sh — the template external
# consumers copy — intentionally differs here: it falls back to
# `npx --yes @optave/codegraph` instead, since a copied project has no

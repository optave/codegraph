# PR Review Sweep

You are performing a full review sweep across all open PRs in this repository. Your goal is to bring every PR to a clean, mergeable state: no conflicts, CI passing, all reviewer comments addressed, and reviewers re-triggered until satisfied.

---

## Step 0: Worktree Isolation

Before doing anything else, run `/worktree` to get an isolated copy of the repo. CLAUDE.md mandates that every session starts with `/worktree` to prevent cross-session interference. All subsequent steps run inside the worktree.

---

## Step 1: Discover Open PRs

```bash
gh pr list --repo optave/codegraph --state open --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName,mergeable,statusCheckRollup,reviewDecision --limit 50
```

Record each PR's number, branch, base, merge status, and CI state.

---

## Step 2: Process Each PR

For **each** open PR, perform the following steps in order. Process PRs one at a time to avoid cross-contamination.

### 2a. Switch to the PR branch

Ensure the working tree is clean before switching to avoid cross-PR contamination:

```bash
if [ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]; then
  git stash push -m "pre-checkout stash"
fi
```

Then check out the PR branch:

```bash
gh pr checkout <number>
```

### 2b. Resolve merge conflicts

Check if the PR has conflicts with its base branch:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json mergeable --jq '.mergeable'
```

If `CONFLICTING`:

1. Merge the base branch into the head branch (never rebase):
   ```bash
   git merge origin/<base-branch>
   ```
2. **Do not assume which side to keep.** You must fully understand the context of both sides before resolving. If you don't know why a line was added — what feature it supports, what bug it fixes, what reviewer requested it — you cannot resolve the conflict correctly. Before touching any conflict:
   - Read the PR description and any linked issues (`gh pr view <number>`) to understand the PR's purpose and scope.
   - Check the PR's commit history (`git log --oneline origin/<base-branch>..HEAD -- <file>`) to understand *why* the conflicting line was changed on the PR side. Also check the base branch history (`git log --oneline HEAD..origin/<base-branch> -- <file>`) to understand *why* the base version exists.
   - Read Greptile and Claude review comments on the PR (`gh api repos/optave/codegraph/pulls/<number>/comments`, `gh api repos/optave/codegraph/pulls/<number>/reviews`, `gh api repos/optave/codegraph/issues/<number>/comments`) — a reviewer may have requested the change that caused the conflict.
   - Check what landed on main that introduced the other side (`git log --oneline HEAD..origin/<base-branch> -- <file>`) and read those PR descriptions too if needed.
   - Compare the PR's diff against its merge base (`git diff $(git merge-base origin/<base-branch> HEAD) HEAD -- <file>`) to see which side introduced an intentional change vs. which side carried stale code.
   - Only then choose the correct resolution. If the PR deliberately changed a line and main still has the old version, keep the PR's version. If main introduced a fix or new feature the PR doesn't have, keep main's version. If both sides made intentional changes, merge them together manually.
3. After resolving, stage the resolved files by name (not `git add .`), commit with: `fix: resolve merge conflicts with <base-branch>`
4. Push the updated branch.

### 2c. Check CI status

```bash
gh pr checks <number>
```

If any checks are failing:

1. Read the failing check logs:
   ```bash
   gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
   ```
2. Diagnose the failure — read the relevant source files, understand the error.
3. Fix the issue in code.
4. Run tests locally to verify: `npm test`
5. Run lint locally: `npm run lint`
6. Commit the fix with a descriptive message: `fix: <what was broken and why>`
7. Push and wait for CI to re-run. Check again:
   ```bash
   gh pr checks <number>
   ```
8. Repeat until CI is green.

### 2d. Gather all review comments

Fetch **all** review comments from both Claude and Greptile. You MUST check all three endpoints — Claude's feedback often appears in the `/reviews` and `/comments` endpoints, not just issue comments:

```bash
# PR review comments (inline code comments — Claude and Greptile both use these)
gh api repos/optave/codegraph/pulls/<number>/comments --paginate --jq '.[] | {id: .id, user: .user.login, body: .body, path: .path, line: .line, created_at: .created_at}'

# PR reviews (top-level review bodies — Claude typically posts CHANGES_REQUESTED or COMMENT reviews here)
gh api repos/optave/codegraph/pulls/<number>/reviews --paginate --jq '.[] | {id: .id, user: .user.login, body: .body, state: .state}'

# Issue-style comments (includes @greptileai trigger responses and general discussion)
gh api repos/optave/codegraph/issues/<number>/comments --paginate --jq '.[] | {id: .id, user: .user.login, body: .body, created_at: .created_at}'
```

**Important:** Go through the results from ALL three endpoints. Build a complete list of actionable items from every reviewer before starting fixes. Do not skip any reviewer's comments.

### 2e. Address every comment from EVERY reviewer

You must address comments from **all** reviewers — Claude (claude-code-review bot), Greptile, and any humans. Do not only address one reviewer's comments and skip another's. Process each reviewer's feedback systematically.

For **each** review comment — including minor suggestions, nits, style feedback, and optional improvements:

1. **Read the comment carefully.** Understand what the reviewer is asking for.
2. **Read the relevant code** at the file and line referenced.
3. **Make the change.** Even if the comment is marked as "nit" or "suggestion" or "minor" — address it. The goal is zero outstanding comments.
4. **If you disagree** with a suggestion (e.g., it would introduce a bug or contradicts project conventions), do NOT silently ignore it. Reply to the comment explaining why you chose a different approach.
5. **If the fix is genuinely out of scope** for this PR, you MUST create a GitHub issue to track it before replying. Never reply with "acknowledged as follow-up" or "noted for later" without a tracked issue — untracked deferrals get lost and nobody will ever revisit them. "Genuinely out of scope" means the fix touches a different module not in the PR's diff, requires an architectural decision beyond the PR's mandate, or would introduce unrelated risk. Fixing a variable name, adding a null check, or adjusting a string in a file already in the diff is NOT out of scope — just do it.

   ```bash
   # Ensure the follow-up label exists (safe to re-run)
   gh label create "follow-up" --color "0e8a16" --description "Deferred from PR review" --repo optave/codegraph 2>/dev/null || true

   # Create a tracking issue for the deferred item
   gh issue create \
     --repo optave/codegraph \
     --title "follow-up: <concise description of what needs to be done>" \
     --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   Deferred from PR #<number> review.

   **Original reviewer comment:** https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/<number>#discussion_r<comment-id>

   **Context:** <why this is out of scope for the current PR and what the fix entails>
   EOF
   )" \
     --label "follow-up"
   ```

   Then reply to the reviewer comment referencing the issue. Use the same reply mechanism as step 6 below — inline PR review comments use `/pulls/<number>/comments/<comment-id>/replies`, top-level review bodies and issue-style comments use `/issues/<number>/comments`:
   ```bash
   # For inline PR review comments:
   gh api repos/optave/codegraph/pulls/<number>/comments/<comment-id>/replies \
     -f body="Out of scope for this PR — tracked in #<issue-number>"
   # For top-level review bodies or issue-style comments:
   gh api repos/optave/codegraph/issues/<number>/comments \
     -f body="Out of scope for this PR — tracked in #<issue-number>"
   ```
6. **Reply to each comment** explaining what you did. The reply mechanism depends on where the comment lives:

   **For inline PR review comments** (from Claude, Greptile, or humans — these have a `path` and `line`):
   ```bash
   gh api repos/optave/codegraph/pulls/<number>/comments/<comment-id>/replies \
     -f body="Fixed — <brief description of what was changed>"
   ```

   **For top-level PR review bodies** (Claude often leaves a summary review with `CHANGES_REQUESTED` or `COMMENT` state — these come from the `/reviews` endpoint and have no `path`):
   ```bash
   # Reply on the PR conversation thread so the reviewer sees it
   gh api repos/optave/codegraph/issues/<number>/comments \
     -f body=$'Addressed Claude\'s review feedback:\n- <bullet per item addressed>'
   ```

   **For issue-style comments** (includes @greptileai trigger responses):
   ```bash
   gh api repos/optave/codegraph/issues/<number>/comments \
     -f body="Addressed: <summary of changes made>"
   ```

**Checklist before moving on:** After addressing all comments, verify you haven't missed a reviewer:
```bash
# List all unique reviewers who left comments
gh api repos/optave/codegraph/pulls/<number>/comments --paginate --jq '[.[].user.login] | unique | .[]'
gh api repos/optave/codegraph/pulls/<number>/reviews --paginate --jq '[.[].user.login] | unique | .[]'
gh api repos/optave/codegraph/issues/<number>/comments --paginate --jq '[.[].user.login] | unique | .[]'
# Confirm you addressed comments from EVERY reviewer listed
```

### 2f. Commit and push fixes

After addressing all comments for a PR:

1. Stage only the files you changed.
2. Group changes by concern — each logically distinct fix gets its own commit (e.g., one commit for a missing validation, another for a naming change). Do not lump all feedback into a single commit.
3. Use descriptive messages per commit: `fix: <what this specific change does> (#<number>)`
4. Push to the PR branch.

### 2g. Re-trigger reviewers

**Greptile:** Before re-triggering, check if your last reply to Greptile already has a positive emoji reaction (👍, ✅, 🎉, etc.) from `greptileai`. A positive reaction means Greptile is satisfied with your fix — do NOT re-trigger in that case, move on. Only re-trigger if there is no positive reaction on your last comment:

```bash
# Check reactions on your most recent comment to see if Greptile already approved
gh api repos/optave/codegraph/issues/<number>/comments --paginate \
  --jq 'reverse | .[] | select(.user.login != "greptileai") | {id: .id, body: .body[0:80], reactions_url: .reactions_url}' | head -1

# If no positive reaction from greptileai, re-trigger:
gh api repos/optave/codegraph/issues/<number>/comments \
  -f body="@greptileai"
```

**Claude (claude-code-review / claude bot):** Only re-trigger if you addressed something Claude specifically suggested. If you did:

```bash
gh api repos/optave/codegraph/issues/<number>/comments \
  -f body="@claude"
```

If all changes were only in response to Greptile feedback, do NOT re-trigger Claude.

### 2h. Wait and re-check

After re-triggering:

1. Wait for the new reviews to come in (check after a reasonable interval).
2. Fetch new comments again (repeat Step 2d).
3. If there are **new** comments from Greptile or Claude, go back to Step 2e and address them.
4. **Repeat this loop for a maximum of 3 rounds.** If after 3 rounds there are still actionable comments, mark the PR as "needs human review" in the summary table and move to the next PR.
5. Verify CI is still green after all changes.

## Step 3: Summary

After processing all PRs, output a summary table:

```
| PR | Branch | Conflicts | CI | Comments Addressed | Reviewers Re-triggered | Status |
|----|--------|-----------|----|--------------------|----------------------|--------|
| #N | branch | resolved/none | green/red | N comments | greptile, claude | ready/needs-work |
```

---

## Rules

- **Never rebase.** Always `git merge <base>` to resolve conflicts.
- **Never force-push** unless fixing a commit message that fails commitlint. Amend + force-push is the only way to fix a pushed commit title (messages are part of the SHA). This is safe on feature branches. For all other problems, fix with a new commit.
- **Address ALL comments from ALL reviewers** (Claude, Greptile, and humans), even minor/nit/optional ones. Leave zero unaddressed. Do not only respond to one reviewer and skip another.
- **Always reply to comments** explaining what was done. Don't just fix silently. Every reviewer must see a reply on their feedback.
- **Don't re-trigger Greptile if already approved.** If your last reply to a Greptile comment has a positive emoji reaction (👍, ✅, 🎉) from `greptileai`, it's already satisfied — skip re-triggering.
- **Only re-trigger Claude** if you addressed Claude's feedback specifically.
- **No co-author lines** in commit messages.
- **No Claude Code references** in commit messages or comments.
- **Run tests and lint locally** before pushing any fix.
- **One concern per commit** — don't lump conflict resolution with code fixes.
- **Flag scope creep.** If a PR's diff contains files unrelated to its stated purpose (e.g., a docs PR carrying `src/` or test changes from a merged feature branch), flag it immediately. Split the unrelated changes into a separate branch and PR. Do not proceed with review until the PR is scoped correctly — scope creep is not acceptable.
- If a PR is fundamentally broken beyond what review feedback can fix, note it in the summary and skip to the next PR.
- **Never defer without tracking.** Do not reply "acknowledged as follow-up", "noted for later", or "tracking for follow-up" to a reviewer comment without creating a GitHub issue first. If you can't fix it now and it's genuinely out of scope, create an issue with the `follow-up` label and include the issue link in your reply. Untracked acknowledgements are the same as ignoring the comment — they will never be revisited.

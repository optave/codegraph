## The Problem

AI coding assistants are incredible — until your codebase gets big enough. Then they get lost.

On a large codebase, a great portion of your AI budget isn't going toward solving tasks. It's going toward the AI re-orienting itself in your code. Every session. Over and over. It burns tokens on tool calls — `grep`, `find`, `cat` — just to figure out what calls what. It loses context. It hallucinates dependencies. It modifies a function without realizing 14 callers across 9 files depend on it.

When the AI catches these mistakes, you waste time and tokens on corrections. When it doesn't catch them, your codebase starts degrading with silent bugs until things stop working.

And when you hit `/clear` or run out of context? It starts from scratch.

## What Codegraph Does

Codegraph gives your AI a pre-built, always-current map of your entire codebase — every function, every caller, every dependency — so it stops guessing and starts knowing.

It parses your code with [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/) (native Rust or WASM), builds a function-level dependency graph in SQLite, and keeps it current with sub-second incremental rebuilds. Your AI gets answers like _"this function has 14 callers across 9 files"_ instantly, instead of spending 30 tool calls to maybe discover half of them.

**Free. Open source. Fully local.** Zero network calls, zero telemetry. Your code stays on your machine. When you want deeper intelligence, bring your own LLM provider — your code only goes where you choose to send it.

**Three commands to get started:**

```bash
npm install -g @optave/codegraph
cd your-project
codegraph build
```

That's it. No config files, no Docker, no JVM, no API keys, no accounts. The graph is ready to query. Add `codegraph mcp` to your AI agent's config and it has full access to your dependency graph through 30 MCP tools (31 in multi-repo mode).

### Why it matters

| Without codegraph | With codegraph |
|---|---|
| AI spends 20+ tool calls per session re-discovering your code structure | AI gets full dependency context in one call |
| Modifies `parseConfig()` without knowing 9 files import it | `fn-impact parseConfig` shows every caller before the edit |
| Hallucinates that `auth.js` imports from `db.js` | `deps src/auth.js` shows the real import graph |
| After `/clear`, starts from scratch | Graph persists — next session picks up where this one left off |
| Suggests renaming a function, breaks 14 call sites silently | `diff-impact --staged` catches the breakage before you commit |

### What makes codegraph different

| | Differentiator | In practice |
|---|---|---|
| **⚡** | **Always-fresh graph** | Three-tier change detection: journal (O(changed)) → mtime+size (O(n) stats) → hash (O(changed) reads). Sub-second rebuilds even on large codebases |
| **🔓** | **Zero-cost core, LLM-enhanced when you want** | Full graph analysis with no API keys, no accounts, no cost. Optionally bring your own LLM provider — your code only goes where you choose |
| **🔬** | **Function-level, not just files** | Traces `handleAuth()` → `validateToken()` → `decryptJWT()` and shows 14 callers across 9 files break if `decryptJWT` changes |
| **🏷️** | **Role classification** | Every symbol auto-tagged as `entry`/`core`/`utility`/`adapter`/`dead`/`leaf` — agents instantly know what they're looking at |
| **🤖** | **Built for AI agents** | 30-tool [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) — AI assistants query your graph directly. Single-repo by default |
| **🌐** | **Multi-language, one CLI** | JS/TS + Python + Go + Rust + Java + C# + PHP + Ruby + HCL in a single graph |
| **💥** | **Git diff impact** | `codegraph diff-impact` shows changed functions, their callers, and full blast radius — enriched with historically coupled files from git co-change analysis. Ships with a GitHub Actions workflow |
| **🧠** | **Hybrid search** | BM25 keyword + semantic embeddings fused via RRF — `hybrid` (default), `semantic`, or `keyword` mode; multi-query via `"auth; token; JWT"` |

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @optave/codegraph

# Build a graph for any project
cd your-project
codegraph build        # → .codegraph/graph.db created

# Start exploring
codegraph map          # see most-connected files
codegraph query myFunc # find any function, see callers & callees
codegraph deps src/index.ts  # file-level import/export map
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/optave/codegraph.git
cd codegraph && npm install && npm link
```

> **Dev builds:** Pre-release tarballs are attached to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/releases). Install with `npm install -g <path-to-tarball>`. Note that `npm install -g <tarball-url>` does not work because npm cannot resolve optional platform-specific dependencies from a URL — download the `.tgz` first, then install from the local file.

### For AI agents

Add codegraph to your agent's instructions (e.g. `CLAUDE.md`):

```markdown
Before modifying code, always:
1. `codegraph where <name>` — find where the symbol lives
2. `codegraph context <name> -T` — get full context (source, deps, callers)
3. `codegraph fn-impact <name> -T` — check blast radius before editing

After modifying code:
4. `codegraph diff-impact --staged -T` — verify impact before committing
```

Or connect directly via MCP:

```bash
codegraph mcp          # 30-tool MCP server — AI queries the graph directly
```

Full agent setup: [AI Agent Guide](docs/guides/ai-agent-guide.md) &middot; [CLAUDE.md template](docs/guides/ai-agent-guide.md#claudemd-template)

```

### Co-Change Analysis

Analyze git history to find files that always change together — surfaces hidden coupling the static graph can't see. Requires a git repository.

```bash
codegraph co-change --analyze          # Scan git history and populate co-change data
codegraph co-change src/queries.js     # Show co-change partners for a file
codegraph co-change                    # Show top co-changing file pairs globally
codegraph co-change --since 6m         # Limit to last 6 months of history
codegraph co-change --min-jaccard 0.5  # Only show strong coupling (Jaccard >= 0.5)
codegraph co-change --min-support 5    # Minimum co-commit count
codegraph co-change --full             # Include all details
```

Co-change data also enriches `diff-impact` — historically coupled files appear in a `historicallyCoupled` section alongside the static dependency analysis.

### Structure & Hotspots

```bash
codegraph structure            # Directory overview with cohesion scores
codegraph triage --level file  # Files with extreme fan-in, fan-out, or density
codegraph triage --level directory --sort coupling --no-tests
```

### Code Health & Architecture

```bash
codegraph complexity              # Per-function cognitive, cyclomatic, nesting, MI
codegraph complexity --health -T  # Full Halstead health view (volume, effort, bugs, MI)
codegraph complexity --sort mi -T # Sort by worst maintainability index
codegraph complexity --above-threshold -T  # Only functions exceeding warn thresholds
codegraph communities             # Louvain community detection — natural module boundaries
codegraph communities --drift -T  # Drift analysis only — split/merge candidates
codegraph communities --functions # Function-level community detection
codegraph check                   # Pass/fail rule engine (exit code 1 on fail)
codegraph check -T                # Exclude test files from rule evaluation
```

### Audit, Triage & Batch

Composite commands for risk-driven workflows and multi-agent dispatch.

```bash
codegraph audit <file-or-function>    # Combined structural summary + impact + health in one report
codegraph audit <target> --quick      # Structural summary only (skip impact and health)
codegraph audit src/queries.js -T     # Audit all functions in a file
codegraph triage                      # Ranked audit priority queue (connectivity + hotspots + roles)
codegraph triage -T --limit 20        # Top 20 riskiest functions, excluding tests
codegraph triage --level file -T      # File-level hotspot analysis
codegraph triage --level directory -T # Directory-level hotspot analysis
codegraph batch target1 target2 ...   # Batch query multiple targets in one call
codegraph batch --json targets.json   # Batch from a JSON file
```

### CI Validation

`codegraph check` provides configurable pass/fail predicates for CI gates and state machines. Exit code 0 = pass, 1 = fail.

```bash
codegraph check                             # Run manifesto rules on whole codebase
codegraph check --staged                    # Check staged changes (diff predicates)
codegraph check --staged --rules            # Run both diff predicates AND manifesto rules
codegraph check --no-new-cycles             # Fail if staged changes introduce cycles
codegraph check --max-complexity 30         # Fail if any function exceeds complexity threshold
codegraph check --max-blast-radius 50       # Fail if blast radius exceeds limit
codegraph check --no-boundary-violations    # Fail on architecture boundary violations
codegraph check main                        # Check current branch vs main
```

### CODEOWNERS

Map graph symbols to CODEOWNERS entries. Shows who owns each function and surfaces ownership boundaries.

```bash
codegraph owners                   # Show ownership for all symbols
codegraph owners src/queries.js    # Ownership for symbols in a specific file
codegraph owners --boundary        # Show ownership boundaries between modules
codegraph owners --owner @backend  # Filter by owner
```

Ownership data also enriches `diff-impact` — affected owners and suggested reviewers appear alongside the static dependency analysis.

### Snapshots

Lightweight SQLite DB backup and restore — checkpoint before refactoring, instantly rollback without rebuilding.

```bash
codegraph snapshot save before-refactor   # Save a named snapshot
codegraph snapshot list                   # List all snapshots
codegraph snapshot restore before-refactor  # Restore a snapshot
codegraph snapshot delete before-refactor   # Delete a snapshot
```

### Export & Visualization

```bash
codegraph export -f dot        # Graphviz DOT format
codegraph export -f mermaid    # Mermaid diagram
codegraph export -f json       # JSON graph
codegraph export --functions -o graph.dot  # Function-level, write to file
codegraph cycles               # Detect circular dependencies
codegraph cycles --functions   # Function-level cycles
```

### Semantic Search

Local embeddings for every function, method, and class — search by natural language. Everything runs locally using [@huggingface/transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js) — no API keys needed.

```bash
codegraph embed                # Build embeddings (default: nomic-v1.5)
codegraph embed --model nomic  # Use a different model
codegraph search "handle authentication"
codegraph search "parse config" --min-score 0.4 -n 10
codegraph search "parseConfig" --mode keyword   # BM25 keyword-only (exact names)
codegraph search "auth flow" --mode semantic    # Embedding-only (conceptual)
codegraph search "auth flow" --mode hybrid      # BM25 + semantic RRF fusion (default)
codegraph models               # List available models
```

#### Multi-query search

Separate queries with `;` to search from multiple angles at once. Results are ranked using [Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/cormacksigir09-rrf.pdf) — items that rank highly across multiple queries rise to the top.

```bash
codegraph search "auth middleware; JWT validation"
codegraph search "parse config; read settings; load env" -n 20
codegraph search "error handling; retry logic" --kind function
codegraph search "database connection; query builder" --rrf-k 30
```

A single trailing semicolon is ignored (falls back to single-query mode). The `--rrf-k` flag controls the RRF smoothing constant (default 60) — lower values give more weight to top-ranked results.

#### Available Models

| Flag | Model | Dimensions | Size | License | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `minilm` | all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | 384 | ~23 MB | Apache-2.0 | Fastest, good for quick iteration |
| `jina-small` | jina-embeddings-v2-small-en | 512 | ~33 MB | Apache-2.0 | Better quality, still small |
| `jina-base` | jina-embeddings-v2-base-en | 768 | ~137 MB | Apache-2.0 | High quality, 8192 token context |
| `jina-code` | jina-embeddings-v2-base-code | 768 | ~137 MB | Apache-2.0 | Best for code search, trained on code+text (requires HF token) |
| `nomic` | nomic-embed-text-v1 | 768 | ~137 MB | Apache-2.0 | Good quality, 8192 context |
| `nomic-v1.5` (default) | nomic-embed-text-v1.5 | 768 | ~137 MB | Apache-2.0 | **Improved nomic, Matryoshka dimensions** |
| `bge-large` | bge-large-en-v1.5 | 1024 | ~335 MB | MIT | Best general retrieval, top MTEB scores |

The model used during `embed` is stored in the database, so `search` auto-detects it — no need to pass `--model` when searching.

### Multi-Repo Registry

Manage a global registry of codegraph-enabled projects. The registry stores paths to your built graphs so the MCP server can query them when multi-repo mode is enabled.

```bash
codegraph registry list        # List all registered repos
codegraph registry list --json # JSON output
codegraph registry add <dir>   # Register a project directory
codegraph registry add <dir> -n my-name  # Custom name
codegraph registry remove <name>  # Unregister
```

`codegraph build` auto-registers the project — no manual setup needed.

### Common Flags

```

1. **Parse** — tree-sitter parses every source file into an AST (native Rust engine or WASM fallback)
2. **Extract** — Functions, classes, methods, interfaces, imports, exports, and call sites are extracted
3. **Resolve** — Imports are resolved to actual files (handles ESM conventions, `tsconfig.json` path aliases, `baseUrl`)
4. **Store** — Everything goes into SQLite as nodes + edges with tree-sitter node boundaries
5. **Query** — All queries run locally against the SQLite DB — typically under 100ms

### Incremental Rebuilds

The graph stays current without re-parsing your entire codebase. Three-tier change detection ensures rebuilds are proportional to what changed, not the size of the project:

1. **Tier 0 — Journal (O(changed)):** If `codegraph watch` was running, a change journal records exactly which files were touched. The next build reads the journal and only processes those files — zero filesystem scanning
2. **Tier 1 — mtime+size (O(n) stats, O(changed) reads):** No journal? Codegraph stats every file and compares mtime + size against stored values. Matching files are skipped without reading a single byte
3. **Tier 2 — Hash (O(changed) reads):** Files that fail the mtime/size check are read and MD5-hashed. Only files whose hash actually changed get re-parsed and re-inserted

**Result:** change one file in a 3,000-file project and the rebuild completes in under a second. Put it in a commit hook, a file watcher, or let your AI agent trigger it.

### Dual Engine

Codegraph ships with two parsing engines:

| Engine | How it works | When it's used |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Native** (Rust) | napi-rs addon built from `crates/codegraph-core/` — parallel multi-core parsing via rayon | Auto-selected when the prebuilt binary is available |
| **WASM** | `web-tree-sitter` with pre-built `.wasm` grammars in `grammars/` | Fallback when the native addon isn't installed |

Both engines produce identical output. Use `--engine native|wasm|auto` to control selection (default: `auto`).

### Call Resolution

Calls are resolved with **qualified resolution** — method calls (`obj.method()`) are distinguished from standalone function calls, and built-in receivers (`console`, `Math`, `JSON`, `Array`, `Promise`, etc.) are filtered out automatically. Import scope is respected: a call to `foo()` only resolves to functions that are actually imported or defined in the same file, eliminating false positives from name collisions.

| Priority | Source | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Import-aware** — `import { foo } from './bar'` → link to `bar` | `1.0` |
| 2 | **Same-file** — definitions in the current file | `1.0` |
| 3 | **Same directory** — definitions in sibling files (standalone calls only) | `0.7` |
| 4 | **Same parent directory** — definitions in sibling dirs (standalone calls only) | `0.5` |
| 5 | **Method hierarchy** — resolved through `extends`/`implements` | varies |

Method calls on unknown receivers skip global fallback entirely — `stmt.run()` will never resolve to a standalone `run` function in another file. Duplicate caller/callee edges are deduplicated automatically. Dynamic patterns like `fn.call()`, `fn.apply()`, `fn.bind()`, and `obj["method"]()` are also detected on a best-effort basis.

Codegraph also extracts symbols from common callback patterns: Commander `.command().action()` callbacks (as `command:build`), Express route handlers (as `route:GET /api/users`), and event emitter listeners (as `event:data`).

## 📊 Performance

Self-measured on every release via CI ([build benchmarks](generated/benchmarks/BUILD-BENCHMARKS.md) | [embedding benchmarks](generated/benchmarks/EMBEDDING-BENCHMARKS.md)):

| Metric | Latest |
|---|---|
| Build speed (native) | **1.9 ms/file** |
| Build speed (WASM) | **8.3 ms/file** |
| Query time | **3ms** |
| No-op rebuild (native) | **4ms** |
| 1-file rebuild (native) | **124ms** |
| Query: fn-deps | **1.4ms** |
| Query: path | **1.4ms** |
| ~50,000 files (est.) | **~95.0s build** |

Metrics are normalized per file for cross-version comparability. Times above are for a full initial build — incremental rebuilds only re-parse changed files.

## 🤖 AI Agent Integration

### MCP Server

Codegraph includes a built-in [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server with 30 tools (31 in multi-repo mode), so AI assistants can query your dependency graph directly:

```bash
codegraph mcp                  # Single-repo mode (default) — only local project
codegraph mcp --multi-repo     # Enable access to all registered repos
codegraph mcp --repos a,b      # Restrict to specific repos (implies --multi-repo)
```

**Single-repo mode (default):** Tools operate only on the local `.codegraph/graph.db`. The `repo` parameter and `list_repos` tool are not exposed to the AI agent.

**Multi-repo mode (`--multi-repo`):** All tools gain an optional `repo` parameter to target any registered repository, and `list_repos` becomes available. Use `--repos` to restrict which repos the agent can access.

### CLAUDE.md / Agent Instructions

Add this to your project's `CLAUDE.md` to help AI agents use codegraph (full template in the [AI Agent Guide](docs/guides/ai-agent-guide.md#claudemd-template)):

```markdown
## Code Navigation

This project uses codegraph. The database is at `.codegraph/graph.db`.

### Before modifying code, always:
1. `codegraph where <name>` — find where the symbol lives
2. `codegraph audit <file-or-function> --quick` — understand the structure
3. `codegraph context <name> -T` — get full context (source, deps, callers)
4. `codegraph fn-impact <name> -T` — check blast radius before editing

### After modifying code:
5. `codegraph diff-impact --staged -T` — verify impact before committing

### Other useful commands
- `codegraph build .` — rebuild the graph (incremental by default)
- `codegraph map` — module overview
- `codegraph query <name> -T` — function call chain (callers + callees)
- `codegraph path <from> <to> -T` — shortest call path between two symbols
- `codegraph deps <file>` — file-level dependencies
- `codegraph roles --role dead -T` — find dead code (unreferenced symbols)
- `codegraph roles --role core -T` — find core symbols (high fan-in)
- `codegraph co-change <file>` — files that historically change together
- `codegraph complexity -T` — per-function complexity metrics (cognitive, cyclomatic, MI)
- `codegraph communities --drift -T` — module boundary drift analysis
- `codegraph check -T` — pass/fail rule check (CI gate, exit code 1 on fail)
- `codegraph audit <target> -T` — combined structural summary + impact + health in one report
- `codegraph triage -T` — ranked audit priority queue
- `codegraph triage --level file -T` — file-level hotspot analysis
- `codegraph check --staged` — CI validation predicates (exit code 0/1)
- `codegraph batch target1 target2` — batch query multiple targets at once
- `codegraph owners [target]` — CODEOWNERS mapping for symbols
- `codegraph snapshot save <name>` — checkpoint the graph DB before refactoring
- `codegraph branch-compare main HEAD -T` — structural diff between two refs (added/removed/changed symbols)
- `codegraph search "<query>"` — hybrid search (requires `codegraph embed`)
- `codegraph search "<query>" --mode keyword` — BM25 keyword search
- `codegraph cycles` — check for circular dependencies

### Flags
- `-T` / `--no-tests` — exclude test files (use by default)
- `-j` / `--json` — JSON output for programmatic use
- `-f, --file <path>` — scope to a specific file
- `-k, --kind <kind>` — filter by symbol kind

### Semantic search

Use `codegraph search` to find functions by intent rather than exact name.
When a single query might miss results, combine multiple angles with `;`:

  codegraph search "validate auth; check token; verify JWT"
  codegraph search "parse config; load settings" --kind function

Multi-query search uses Reciprocal Rank Fusion — functions that rank
highly across several queries surface first. This is especially useful
when you're not sure what naming convention the codebase uses.

When writing multi-queries, use 2-4 sub-queries (2-4 words each) that
attack the problem from different angles. Pick from these strategies:
- **Naming variants**: cover synonyms the author might have used
  ("send email; notify user; deliver message")
- **Abstraction levels**: pair high-level intent with low-level operation
  ("handle payment; charge credit card")
- **Input/output sides**: cover the read half and write half
  ("parse config; apply settings")
- **Domain + technical**: bridge business language and implementation
  ("onboard tenant; create organization; provision workspace")

Use `--kind function` to cut noise. Use `--file <pattern>` to scope.
```

## 📋 Recommended Practices

See **[docs/guides/recommended-practices.md](docs/guides/recommended-practices.md)** for integration guides:

- **Git hooks** — auto-rebuild on commit, impact checks on push, commit message enrichment
- **CI/CD** — PR impact comments, threshold gates, graph caching
- **AI agents** — MCP server, CLAUDE.md templates, Claude Code hooks
- **Developer workflow** — watch mode, explore-before-you-edit, semantic search
- **Secure credentials** — `apiKeyCommand` with 1Password, Bitwarden, Vault, macOS Keychain, `pass`

For AI-specific integration, see the **[AI Agent Guide](docs/guides/ai-agent-guide.md)** — a comprehensive reference covering the 6-step agent workflow, complete command-to-MCP mapping, Claude Code hooks, and token-saving patterns.

## 🔁 CI / GitHub Actions

Codegraph ships with a ready-to-use GitHub Actions workflow that comments impact analysis on every pull request.

Copy `.github/workflows/codegraph-impact.yml` to your repo, and every PR will get a comment like:

> **3 functions changed** → **12 callers affected** across **7 files**

## 🛠️ Configuration

Create a `.codegraphrc.json` in your project root to customize behavior:

```json
{
  "include": ["src/**", "lib/**"],
  "exclude": ["**/*.test.js", "**/__mocks__/**"],
  "ignoreDirs": ["node_modules", ".git", "dist"],
  "extensions": [".js", ".ts", ".tsx", ".py"],
  "aliases": {
    "@/": "./src/",
    "@utils/": "./src/utils/"
  },
  "build": {
    "incremental": true
  },
  "query": {
    "excludeTests": true
  }
}
```

> **Tip:** `excludeTests` can also be set at the top level as a shorthand — `{ "excludeTests": true }` is equivalent to nesting it under `query`. If both are present, the nested `query.excludeTests` takes precedence.

### Manifesto rules

Configure pass/fail thresholds for `codegraph check` (manifesto mode):

```json
{
  "manifesto": {
    "rules": {
      "cognitive_complexity": { "warn": 15, "fail": 30 },
      "cyclomatic_complexity": { "warn": 10, "fail": 20 },
      "nesting_depth": { "warn": 4, "fail": 6 },
      "maintainability_index": { "warn": 40, "fail": 20 },
      "halstead_bugs": { "warn": 0.5, "fail": 1.0 }
    }
  }
}
```

When any function exceeds a `fail` threshold, `codegraph check` exits with code 1 — perfect for CI gates.

### LLM credentials

Codegraph supports an `apiKeyCommand` field for secure credential management. Instead of storing API keys in config files or environment variables, you can shell out to a secret manager at runtime:

```json
{
  "llm": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "apiKeyCommand": "op read op://vault/openai/api-key"
  }
}
```

The command is split on whitespace and executed with `execFileSync` (no shell injection risk). Priority: **command output > `CODEGRAPH_LLM_API_KEY` env var > file config**. On failure, codegraph warns and falls back to the next source.

Works with any secret manager: 1Password CLI (`op`), Bitwarden (`bw`), `pass`, HashiCorp Vault, macOS Keychain (`security`), AWS Secrets Manager, etc.

## 📖 Programmatic API

Codegraph also exports a full API for use in your own tools:

```js
import { buildGraph, queryNameData, findCycles, exportDOT } from '@optave/codegraph';

// Build the graph
buildGraph('/path/to/project');

// Query programmatically
const results = queryNameData('myFunction', '/path/to/.codegraph/graph.db');
```

```js
import { parseFileAuto, getActiveEngine, isNativeAvailable } from '@optave/codegraph';

// Check which engine is active
console.log(getActiveEngine());      // 'native' or 'wasm'
console.log(isNativeAvailable());    // true if Rust addon is installed

// Parse a single file (uses auto-selected engine)
const symbols = await parseFileAuto('/path/to/file.ts');
```

```js
import { searchData, multiSearchData, buildEmbeddings } from '@optave/codegraph';

// Build embeddings (one-time)
await buildEmbeddings('/path/to/project');

// Single-query search
const { results } = await searchData('handle auth', dbPath);

// Multi-query search with RRF ranking
const { results: fused } = await multiSearchData(
  ['auth middleware', 'JWT validation'],
  dbPath,
  { limit: 10, minScore: 0.3 }
);
// Each result has: { name, kind, file, line, rrf, queryScores[] }
```

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **No full type inference** — parses `.d.ts` interfaces but doesn't use TypeScript's type checker for overload resolution
- **Dynamic calls are best-effort** — complex computed property access and `eval` patterns are not resolved
- **Python imports** — resolves relative imports but doesn't follow `sys.path` or virtual environment packages

## 🗺️ Roadmap

See **[ROADMAP.md](docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md)** for the full development roadmap and **[STABILITY.md](STABILITY.md)** for the stability policy and versioning guarantees. Current plan:

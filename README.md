## The Problem

AI agents face an impossible trade-off. They either spend thousands of tokens reading files to understand a codebase's structure — blowing up their context window until quality degrades — or they assume how things work, and the assumptions are often wrong. Either way, things break. The larger the codebase, the worse it gets.

An agent modifies a function without knowing 9 files import it. It misreads what a helper does and builds logic on top of that misunderstanding. It leaves dead code behind after a refactor. The PR gets opened, and your reviewer — human or automated — flags the same structural issues again and again: _"this breaks 14 callers,"_ _"that function already exists,"_ _"this export is now dead."_ If the reviewer catches it, that's multiple rounds of back-and-forth. If they don't, it can ship to production. Multiply that by every PR, every developer, every repo.

The information to prevent these issues exists — it's in the code itself. But without a structured map, agents lack the context to get it right consistently, reviewers waste cycles on preventable issues, and architecture degrades one unreviewed change at a time.

## What Codegraph Does

Codegraph builds a function-level dependency graph of your entire codebase — every function, every caller, every dependency — and keeps it current with sub-second incremental rebuilds.

It parses your code with [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/) (native Rust or WASM), stores the graph in SQLite, and exposes it where it matters most:

- **MCP server** — AI agents query the graph directly through 30 tools — one call instead of 30 `grep`/`find`/`cat` invocations
- **CLI** — developers and agents explore, query, and audit code from the terminal
- **CI gates** — `check` and `manifesto` commands enforce quality thresholds with exit codes
- **Programmatic API** — embed codegraph in your own tools via `npm install`

Instead of an agent editing code without structural context and letting reviewers catch the fallout, it knows _"this function has 14 callers across 9 files"_ before it touches anything. Dead exports, circular dependencies, and boundary violations surface during development — not during review. The result: PRs that need fewer review rounds.

**Free. Open source. Fully local.** Zero network calls, zero telemetry. Your code stays on your machine. When you want deeper intelligence, bring your own LLM provider — your code only goes where you choose to send it.

**Three commands to a queryable graph:**

```bash
npm install -g @optave/codegraph
cd your-project
codegraph build
```

No config files, no Docker, no JVM, no API keys, no accounts. Point your agent at the MCP server and it has structural awareness of your codebase.

### Why it matters

| | Without codegraph | With codegraph |
|---|---|---|
| **Code review** | Reviewers flag broken callers, dead code, and boundary violations round after round | Structural issues are caught during development — PRs pass review with fewer rounds |
| **AI agents** | Modify `parseConfig()` without knowing 9 files import it — reviewer catches it | `fn-impact parseConfig` shows every caller before the edit — agent fixes it proactively |
| **AI agents** | Leave dead exports and duplicate helpers behind after refactors | Dead code, cycles, and duplicates surface in real time via hooks and MCP queries |
| **AI agents** | Produce code that works but doesn't fit the codebase structure | `context <name> -T` returns source, deps, callers, and tests — the agent writes code that fits |
| **CI pipelines** | Catch test failures but miss structural degradation | `check --staged` fails the build when blast radius or complexity thresholds are exceeded |
| **Developers** | Inherit a codebase and grep for hours to understand what calls what | `context handleAuth -T` gives the same structured view agents use |
| **Architects** | Draw boundary rules that erode within weeks | `manifesto` and `boundaries` enforce architecture rules on every commit |

<sup>¹ narsil-mcp added CFG and dataflow in recent versions. ² Codegraph focuses on structural understanding, not vulnerability detection — use dedicated SAST tools (Semgrep, CodeQL, Snyk) for that. ³ axon claims MIT in pyproject.toml but has no LICENSE file in the repo. ⁴ GitNexus skips re-index if the git commit hasn't changed, but re-processes the entire repo when it does — no per-file incremental parsing. ⁵ GitNexus uses the PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 license.</sup>

### What makes codegraph different

| | Differentiator | In practice |
|---|---|---|
| **🤖** | **AI-first architecture** | 30-tool [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) — agents query the graph directly instead of scraping the filesystem. One call replaces 20+ grep/find/cat invocations |
| **🏷️** | **Role classification** | Every symbol auto-tagged as `entry`/`core`/`utility`/`adapter`/`dead`/`leaf` — agents understand a symbol's architectural role without reading surrounding code |
| **🔬** | **Function-level, not just files** | Traces `handleAuth()` → `validateToken()` → `decryptJWT()` and shows 14 callers across 9 files break if `decryptJWT` changes |
| **⚡** | **Always-fresh graph** | Three-tier change detection: journal (O(changed)) → mtime+size (O(n) stats) → hash (O(changed) reads). Sub-second rebuilds — agents work with current data |
| **💥** | **Git diff impact** | `codegraph diff-impact` shows changed functions, their callers, and full blast radius — enriched with historically coupled files from git co-change analysis. Ships with a GitHub Actions workflow |
| **🌐** | **Multi-language, one graph** | JS/TS + Python + Go + Rust + Java + C# + PHP + Ruby + HCL in a single graph — agents don't need per-language tools |
| **🧠** | **Hybrid search** | BM25 keyword + semantic embeddings fused via RRF — `hybrid` (default), `semantic`, or `keyword` mode; multi-query via `"auth; token; JWT"` |
| **🔬** | **Dataflow + CFG** | Track how data flows through functions (`flows_to`, `returns`, `mutates`) and visualize intraprocedural control flow graphs for all 11 languages |
| **🔓** | **Fully local, zero cost** | No API keys, no accounts, no network calls. Optionally bring your own LLM provider — your code only goes where you choose |

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g @optave/codegraph
cd your-project
codegraph build        # → .codegraph/graph.db created
```

That's it. The graph is ready. Now connect your AI agent.

### For AI agents (primary use case)

Connect directly via MCP — your agent gets 30 tools to query the graph:

```bash
codegraph mcp          # 33-tool MCP server — AI queries the graph directly
```

Or add codegraph to your agent's instructions (e.g. `CLAUDE.md`):

```markdown
Before modifying code, always:
1. `codegraph where <name>` — find where the symbol lives
2. `codegraph context <name> -T` — get full context (source, deps, callers)
3. `codegraph fn-impact <name> -T` — check blast radius before editing

After modifying code:
4. `codegraph diff-impact --staged -T` — verify impact before committing
```

Full agent setup: [AI Agent Guide](docs/guides/ai-agent-guide.md) &middot; [CLAUDE.md template](docs/guides/ai-agent-guide.md#claudemd-template)

### For developers

The same graph is available via CLI:

```bash
codegraph map          # see most-connected files
codegraph query myFunc # find any function, see callers & callees
codegraph deps src/index.ts  # file-level import/export map
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/optave/codegraph.git
cd codegraph && npm install && npm link
```

> **Dev builds:** Pre-release tarballs are attached to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/releases). Install with `npm install -g <path-to-tarball>`. Note that `npm install -g <tarball-url>` does not work because npm cannot resolve optional platform-specific dependencies from a URL — download the `.tgz` first, then install from the local file.

```

### Co-Change Analysis

Analyze git history to find files that always change together — surfaces hidden coupling the static graph can't see. Requires a git repository.

```bash
codegraph co-change --analyze          # Scan git history and populate co-change data
codegraph co-change src/queries.js     # Show co-change partners for a file
codegraph co-change                    # Show top co-changing file pairs globally
codegraph co-change --since 6m         # Limit to last 6 months of history
codegraph co-change --min-jaccard 0.5  # Only show strong coupling (Jaccard >= 0.5)
codegraph co-change --min-support 5    # Minimum co-commit count
codegraph co-change --full             # Include all details
```

Co-change data also enriches `diff-impact` — historically coupled files appear in a `historicallyCoupled` section alongside the static dependency analysis.

### Structure & Hotspots

```bash
codegraph structure            # Directory overview with cohesion scores
codegraph triage --level file  # Files with extreme fan-in, fan-out, or density
codegraph triage --level directory --sort coupling --no-tests
```

### Code Health & Architecture

```bash
codegraph complexity              # Per-function cognitive, cyclomatic, nesting, MI
codegraph complexity --health -T  # Full Halstead health view (volume, effort, bugs, MI)
codegraph complexity --sort mi -T # Sort by worst maintainability index
codegraph complexity --above-threshold -T  # Only functions exceeding warn thresholds
codegraph communities             # Louvain community detection — natural module boundaries
codegraph communities --drift -T  # Drift analysis only — split/merge candidates
codegraph communities --functions # Function-level community detection
codegraph check                   # Pass/fail rule engine (exit code 1 on fail)
codegraph check -T                # Exclude test files from rule evaluation
```

### Dataflow, CFG & AST

```bash
codegraph dataflow <name>             # Data flow edges for a function (flows_to, returns, mutates)
codegraph dataflow <name> --impact    # Transitive data-dependent blast radius
codegraph cfg <name>                  # Control flow graph (text format)
codegraph cfg <name> --format dot     # CFG as Graphviz DOT
codegraph cfg <name> --format mermaid # CFG as Mermaid diagram
codegraph ast                         # List all stored AST nodes
codegraph ast "handleAuth"            # Search AST nodes by pattern (GLOB)
codegraph ast -k call                 # Filter by kind: call, new, string, regex, throw, await
codegraph ast -k throw --file src/    # Combine kind and file filters
```

> **Note:** Dataflow and CFG are included by default for all 11 languages. Use `--no-dataflow` / `--no-cfg` for faster builds.


### Audit, Triage & Batch

Composite commands for risk-driven workflows and multi-agent dispatch.

```bash
codegraph audit <file-or-function>    # Combined structural summary + impact + health in one report
codegraph audit <target> --quick      # Structural summary only (skip impact and health)
codegraph audit src/queries.js -T     # Audit all functions in a file
codegraph triage                      # Ranked audit priority queue (connectivity + hotspots + roles)
codegraph triage -T --limit 20        # Top 20 riskiest functions, excluding tests
codegraph triage --level file -T      # File-level hotspot analysis
codegraph triage --level directory -T # Directory-level hotspot analysis
codegraph batch target1 target2 ...   # Batch query multiple targets in one call
codegraph batch --json targets.json   # Batch from a JSON file
```

### CI Validation

`codegraph check` provides configurable pass/fail predicates for CI gates and state machines. Exit code 0 = pass, 1 = fail.

```bash
codegraph check                             # Run manifesto rules on whole codebase
codegraph check --staged                    # Check staged changes (diff predicates)
codegraph check --staged --rules            # Run both diff predicates AND manifesto rules
codegraph check --no-new-cycles             # Fail if staged changes introduce cycles
codegraph check --max-complexity 30         # Fail if any function exceeds complexity threshold
codegraph check --max-blast-radius 50       # Fail if blast radius exceeds limit
codegraph check --no-boundary-violations    # Fail on architecture boundary violations
codegraph check main                        # Check current branch vs main
```

### CODEOWNERS

Map graph symbols to CODEOWNERS entries. Shows who owns each function and surfaces ownership boundaries.

```bash
codegraph owners                   # Show ownership for all symbols
codegraph owners src/queries.js    # Ownership for symbols in a specific file
codegraph owners --boundary        # Show ownership boundaries between modules
codegraph owners --owner @backend  # Filter by owner
```

Ownership data also enriches `diff-impact` — affected owners and suggested reviewers appear alongside the static dependency analysis.

### Snapshots

Lightweight SQLite DB backup and restore — checkpoint before refactoring, instantly rollback without rebuilding.

```bash
codegraph snapshot save before-refactor   # Save a named snapshot
codegraph snapshot list                   # List all snapshots
codegraph snapshot restore before-refactor  # Restore a snapshot
codegraph snapshot delete before-refactor   # Delete a snapshot
```

### Export & Visualization

```bash
codegraph export -f dot        # Graphviz DOT format
codegraph export -f mermaid    # Mermaid diagram
codegraph export -f json       # JSON graph
codegraph export -f graphml    # GraphML (XML standard)
codegraph export -f graphson   # GraphSON (TinkerPop v3 / Gremlin)
codegraph export -f neo4j      # Neo4j CSV (bulk import, separate nodes/relationships files)
codegraph export --functions -o graph.dot  # Function-level, write to file
codegraph plot                 # Interactive HTML viewer with force/hierarchical/radial layouts
codegraph cycles               # Detect circular dependencies
codegraph cycles --functions   # Function-level cycles
```

### Semantic Search

Local embeddings for every function, method, and class — search by natural language. Everything runs locally using [@huggingface/transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js) — no API keys needed.

```bash
codegraph embed                # Build embeddings (default: nomic-v1.5)
codegraph embed --model nomic  # Use a different model
codegraph search "handle authentication"
codegraph search "parse config" --min-score 0.4 -n 10
codegraph search "parseConfig" --mode keyword   # BM25 keyword-only (exact names)
codegraph search "auth flow" --mode semantic    # Embedding-only (conceptual)
codegraph search "auth flow" --mode hybrid      # BM25 + semantic RRF fusion (default)
codegraph models               # List available models
```

#### Multi-query search

Separate queries with `;` to search from multiple angles at once. Results are ranked using [Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/cormacksigir09-rrf.pdf) — items that rank highly across multiple queries rise to the top.

```bash
codegraph search "auth middleware; JWT validation"
codegraph search "parse config; read settings; load env" -n 20
codegraph search "error handling; retry logic" --kind function
codegraph search "database connection; query builder" --rrf-k 30
```

A single trailing semicolon is ignored (falls back to single-query mode). The `--rrf-k` flag controls the RRF smoothing constant (default 60) — lower values give more weight to top-ranked results.

#### Available Models

| `nomic` | nomic-embed-text-v1 | 768 | ~137 MB | Apache-2.0 | Good quality, 8192 context |
| `nomic-v1.5` (default) | nomic-embed-text-v1.5 | 768 | ~137 MB | Apache-2.0 | **Improved nomic, Matryoshka dimensions** |
| `bge-large` | bge-large-en-v1.5 | 1024 | ~335 MB | MIT | Best general retrieval, top MTEB scores |

The model used during `embed` is stored in the database, so `search` auto-detects it — no need to pass `--model` when searching.

### Multi-Repo Registry

Manage a global registry of codegraph-enabled projects. The registry stores paths to your built graphs so the MCP server can query them when multi-repo mode is enabled.

```bash
codegraph registry list        # List all registered repos
codegraph registry list --json # JSON output
codegraph registry add <dir>   # Register a project directory
codegraph registry add <dir> -n my-name  # Custom name
codegraph registry remove <name>  # Unregister
```

`codegraph build` auto-registers the project — no manual setup needed.

### Common Flags

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `-d, --db <path>` | Custom path to `graph.db` |
| `-T, --no-tests` | Exclude `.test.`, `.spec.`, `__test__` files (available on most query commands including `query`, `fn-impact`, `path`, `context`, `where`, `diff-impact`, `search`, `map`, `roles`, `co-change`, `deps`, `impact`, `complexity`, `communities`, `branch-compare`, `audit`, `triage`, `check`, `dataflow`, `cfg`, `ast`, `exports`, `children`) |
| `--depth <n>` | Transitive trace depth (default varies by command) |
| `-j, --json` | Output as JSON |
| `-v, --verbose` | Enable debug output |
| `--engine <engine>` | Parser engine: `native`, `wasm`, or `auto` (default: `auto`) |
| `-k, --kind <kind>` | Filter by kind: `function`, `method`, `class`, `interface`, `type`, `struct`, `enum`, `trait`, `record`, `module`, `parameter`, `property`, `constant` |
| `-f, --file <path>` | Scope to a specific file (`fn`, `context`, `where`) |
| `--mode <mode>` | Search mode: `hybrid` (default), `semantic`, or `keyword` (`search`) |
| `--ndjson` | Output as newline-delimited JSON (one object per line) |
| `--table` | Output as auto-column aligned table |
| `--csv` | Output as CSV (RFC 4180, nested objects flattened) |
| `--limit <n>` | Limit number of results |
| `--offset <n>` | Skip first N results (pagination) |
| `--rrf-k <n>` | RRF smoothing constant for multi-query search (default 60) |

> **Type Inference** extracts a per-file type map from annotations (`const x: Router`, `MyType x`, `x: MyType`) and `new` expressions, enabling the edge resolver to connect `x.method()` → `Type.method()`. **Parity** = WASM and native Rust engines produce identical output. ⁴ Ruby and HCL are dynamically typed / declarative — type inference does not apply.

```

1. **Parse** — tree-sitter parses every source file into an AST (native Rust engine or WASM fallback)
2. **Extract** — Functions, classes, methods, interfaces, imports, exports, call sites, parameters, properties, and constants are extracted
3. **Resolve** — Imports are resolved to actual files (handles ESM conventions, `tsconfig.json` path aliases, `baseUrl`)
4. **Store** — Everything goes into SQLite as nodes + edges with tree-sitter node boundaries, plus structural edges (`contains`, `parameter_of`, `receiver`)
5. **Analyze** (opt-in) — Complexity metrics, control flow graphs (`--cfg`), dataflow edges (`--dataflow`), and AST node storage
6. **Query** — All queries run locally against the SQLite DB — typically under 100ms

### Incremental Rebuilds

The graph stays current without re-parsing your entire codebase. Three-tier change detection ensures rebuilds are proportional to what changed, not the size of the project:

1. **Tier 0 — Journal (O(changed)):** If `codegraph watch` was running, a change journal records exactly which files were touched. The next build reads the journal and only processes those files — zero filesystem scanning
2. **Tier 1 — mtime+size (O(n) stats, O(changed) reads):** No journal? Codegraph stats every file and compares mtime + size against stored values. Matching files are skipped without reading a single byte
3. **Tier 2 — Hash (O(changed) reads):** Files that fail the mtime/size check are read and MD5-hashed. Only files whose hash actually changed get re-parsed and re-inserted

**Result:** change one file in a 3,000-file project and the rebuild completes in under a second. Put it in a commit hook, a file watcher, or let your AI agent trigger it.

### Dual Engine

Codegraph ships with two parsing engines:

| Engine | How it works | When it's used |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Native** (Rust) | napi-rs addon built from `crates/codegraph-core/` — parallel multi-core parsing via rayon | Auto-selected when the prebuilt binary is available |
| **WASM** | `web-tree-sitter` with pre-built `.wasm` grammars in `grammars/` | Fallback when the native addon isn't installed |

Both engines produce identical output. Use `--engine native|wasm|auto` to control selection (default: `auto`).

### Call Resolution

Calls are resolved with **qualified resolution** — method calls (`obj.method()`) are distinguished from standalone function calls, and built-in receivers (`console`, `Math`, `JSON`, `Array`, `Promise`, etc.) are filtered out automatically. Import scope is respected: a call to `foo()` only resolves to functions that are actually imported or defined in the same file, eliminating false positives from name collisions.

| Priority | Source | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Import-aware** — `import { foo } from './bar'` → link to `bar` | `1.0` |
| 2 | **Same-file** — definitions in the current file | `1.0` |
| 3 | **Same directory** — definitions in sibling files (standalone calls only) | `0.7` |
| 4 | **Same parent directory** — definitions in sibling dirs (standalone calls only) | `0.5` |
| 5 | **Method hierarchy** — resolved through `extends`/`implements` | varies |

Method calls on unknown receivers skip global fallback entirely — `stmt.run()` will never resolve to a standalone `run` function in another file. Duplicate caller/callee edges are deduplicated automatically. Dynamic patterns like `fn.call()`, `fn.apply()`, `fn.bind()`, and `obj["method"]()` are also detected on a best-effort basis.

Codegraph also extracts symbols from common callback patterns: Commander `.command().action()` callbacks (as `command:build`), Express route handlers (as `route:GET /api/users`), and event emitter listeners (as `event:data`).

## 📊 Performance

Self-measured on every release via CI ([build benchmarks](generated/benchmarks/BUILD-BENCHMARKS.md) | [embedding benchmarks](generated/benchmarks/EMBEDDING-BENCHMARKS.md)):

| Metric | Latest |
|---|---|
| Build speed (native) | **3.5 ms/file** |
| Build speed (WASM) | **9.6 ms/file** |
| Query time | **3ms** |
| No-op rebuild (native) | **9ms** |
| 1-file rebuild (native) | **265ms** |
| Query: fn-deps | **0.9ms** |
| Query: path | **0.9ms** |
| ~50,000 files (est.) | **~175.0s build** |

Metrics are normalized per file for cross-version comparability. Times above are for a full initial build — incremental rebuilds only re-parse changed files.

## 🤖 AI Agent Integration (Core)

### MCP Server

Codegraph is built around a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server with 30 tools (31 in multi-repo mode) — the primary way agents consume the graph:

```bash
codegraph mcp                  # Single-repo mode (default) — only local project
codegraph mcp --multi-repo     # Enable access to all registered repos
codegraph mcp --repos a,b      # Restrict to specific repos (implies --multi-repo)
```

**Single-repo mode (default):** Tools operate only on the local `.codegraph/graph.db`. The `repo` parameter and `list_repos` tool are not exposed to the AI agent.

**Multi-repo mode (`--multi-repo`):** All tools gain an optional `repo` parameter to target any registered repository, and `list_repos` becomes available. Use `--repos` to restrict which repos the agent can access.

### CLAUDE.md / Agent Instructions

Add this to your project's `CLAUDE.md` to help AI agents use codegraph. Full template with all commands in the [AI Agent Guide](docs/guides/ai-agent-guide.md#claudemd-template).

```markdown
## Codegraph

This project uses codegraph for dependency analysis. The graph is at `.codegraph/graph.db`.

### Before modifying code:
1. `codegraph where <name>` — find where the symbol lives
2. `codegraph audit --quick <target>` — understand the structure
3. `codegraph context <name> -T` — get full context (source, deps, callers)
4. `codegraph fn-impact <name> -T` — check blast radius before editing

### After modifying code:
5. `codegraph diff-impact --staged -T` — verify impact before committing

### Other useful commands
- `codegraph build .` — rebuild graph (incremental by default)
- `codegraph map` — module overview · `codegraph stats` — graph health
- `codegraph query <name> -T` — call chain · `codegraph path <from> <to> -T` — shortest path
- `codegraph deps <file>` — file deps · `codegraph exports <file> -T` — export consumers
- `codegraph audit <target> -T` — full risk report · `codegraph triage -T` — priority queue
- `codegraph check --staged` — CI gate · `codegraph batch t1 t2 -T --json` — batch query
- `codegraph search "<query>"` — semantic search · `codegraph cycles` — cycle detection
- `codegraph roles --role dead -T` — dead code · `codegraph complexity -T` — metrics
- `codegraph dataflow <name> -T` — data flow · `codegraph cfg <name> -T` — control flow

### Flags
- `-T` — exclude test files (use by default) · `-j` — JSON output
- `-f, --file <path>` — scope to file · `-k, --kind <kind>` — filter kind
```

## 📋 Recommended Practices

See **[docs/guides/recommended-practices.md](docs/guides/recommended-practices.md)** for integration guides:

- **Git hooks** — auto-rebuild on commit, impact checks on push, commit message enrichment
- **CI/CD** — PR impact comments, threshold gates, graph caching
- **AI agents** — MCP server, CLAUDE.md templates, Claude Code hooks
- **Developer workflow** — watch mode, explore-before-you-edit, semantic search
- **Secure credentials** — `apiKeyCommand` with 1Password, Bitwarden, Vault, macOS Keychain, `pass`

For AI-specific integration, see the **[AI Agent Guide](docs/guides/ai-agent-guide.md)** — a comprehensive reference covering the 6-step agent workflow, complete command-to-MCP mapping, Claude Code hooks, and token-saving patterns.

## 🔁 CI / GitHub Actions

Codegraph ships with a ready-to-use GitHub Actions workflow that comments impact analysis on every pull request.

Copy `.github/workflows/codegraph-impact.yml` to your repo, and every PR will get a comment like:

> **3 functions changed** → **12 callers affected** across **7 files**

## 🛠️ Configuration

Create a `.codegraphrc.json` in your project root to customize behavior:

```json
{
  "include": ["src/**", "lib/**"],
  "exclude": ["**/*.test.js", "**/__mocks__/**"],
  "ignoreDirs": ["node_modules", ".git", "dist"],
  "extensions": [".js", ".ts", ".tsx", ".py"],
  "aliases": {
    "@/": "./src/",
    "@utils/": "./src/utils/"
  },
  "build": {
    "incremental": true
  },
  "query": {
    "excludeTests": true
  }
}
```

> **Tip:** `excludeTests` can also be set at the top level as a shorthand — `{ "excludeTests": true }` is equivalent to nesting it under `query`. If both are present, the nested `query.excludeTests` takes precedence.

### Manifesto rules

Configure pass/fail thresholds for `codegraph check` (manifesto mode):

```json
{
  "manifesto": {
    "rules": {
      "cognitive_complexity": { "warn": 15, "fail": 30 },
      "cyclomatic_complexity": { "warn": 10, "fail": 20 },
      "nesting_depth": { "warn": 4, "fail": 6 },
      "maintainability_index": { "warn": 40, "fail": 20 },
      "halstead_bugs": { "warn": 0.5, "fail": 1.0 }
    }
  }
}
```

When any function exceeds a `fail` threshold, `codegraph check` exits with code 1 — perfect for CI gates.

### LLM credentials

Codegraph supports an `apiKeyCommand` field for secure credential management. Instead of storing API keys in config files or environment variables, you can shell out to a secret manager at runtime:

```json
{
  "llm": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "apiKeyCommand": "op read op://vault/openai/api-key"
  }
}
```

The command is split on whitespace and executed with `execFileSync` (no shell injection risk). Priority: **command output > `CODEGRAPH_LLM_API_KEY` env var > file config**. On failure, codegraph warns and falls back to the next source.

Works with any secret manager: 1Password CLI (`op`), Bitwarden (`bw`), `pass`, HashiCorp Vault, macOS Keychain (`security`), AWS Secrets Manager, etc.

## 📖 Programmatic API

Codegraph also exports a full API for use in your own tools:

```js
import { buildGraph, queryNameData, findCycles, exportDOT, normalizeSymbol } from '@optave/codegraph';

// Build the graph
buildGraph('/path/to/project');

// Query programmatically
const results = queryNameData('myFunction', '/path/to/.codegraph/graph.db');
// All query results use normalizeSymbol for a stable 7-field schema
```

```js
import { parseFileAuto, getActiveEngine, isNativeAvailable } from '@optave/codegraph';

// Check which engine is active
console.log(getActiveEngine());      // 'native' or 'wasm'
console.log(isNativeAvailable());    // true if Rust addon is installed

// Parse a single file (uses auto-selected engine)
const symbols = await parseFileAuto('/path/to/file.ts');
```

```js
import { searchData, multiSearchData, buildEmbeddings } from '@optave/codegraph';

// Build embeddings (one-time)
await buildEmbeddings('/path/to/project');

// Single-query search
const { results } = await searchData('handle auth', dbPath);

// Multi-query search with RRF ranking
const { results: fused } = await multiSearchData(
  ['auth middleware', 'JWT validation'],
  dbPath,
  { limit: 10, minScore: 0.3 }
);
// Each result has: { name, kind, file, line, rrf, queryScores[] }
```

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **No TypeScript type-checker integration** — type inference resolves annotations, `new` expressions, and assignment chains, but does not invoke `tsc` for overload resolution or complex generics
- **Dynamic calls are best-effort** — complex computed property access and `eval` patterns are not resolved
- **Python imports** — resolves relative imports but doesn't follow `sys.path` or virtual environment packages
- **Dataflow analysis** — intraprocedural (single-function scope), not interprocedural

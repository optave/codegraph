# Recommended Practices

Practical patterns for integrating codegraph into your development workflow.

---

## Git Hooks

### Pre-commit: rebuild the graph

Keep your graph up to date automatically. Add this to your git hooks so the database is always fresh before you commit.

**With [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) (recommended):**

```bash
npm install -D husky
npx husky init
echo "codegraph build" > .husky/pre-commit
```

**With a plain git hook:**

```bash
echo '#!/bin/sh
codegraph build' > .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Pre-push: impact check

See what your branch will affect before pushing:

```bash
# .husky/pre-push
codegraph build
codegraph diff-impact --ref origin/main --no-tests
```

This prints a summary like:

```
3 functions changed → 12 callers affected across 7 files
```

If you want to **block pushes** that exceed a threshold, add a check:

```bash
# .husky/pre-push
codegraph build
IMPACT=$(codegraph diff-impact --ref origin/main --no-tests --json)
AFFECTED=$(echo "$IMPACT" | node -e "
  const d = JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin','utf8'));
  console.log(d.summary?.callersAffected || 0)
")
if [ "$AFFECTED" -gt 50 ]; then
  echo "WARNING: $AFFECTED callers affected. Review with 'codegraph diff-impact' before pushing."
  exit 1
fi
```

### Commit message enrichment

Automatically append impact info to commit messages:

```bash
# .husky/prepare-commit-msg
IMPACT=$(codegraph diff-impact --staged --no-tests --json 2>/dev/null)
SUMMARY=$(echo "$IMPACT" | node -e "
  const d = JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin','utf8'));
  if (d.summary) console.log('Impact: ' + d.summary.functionsChanged + ' functions changed, ' + d.summary.callersAffected + ' callers affected');
" 2>/dev/null)
if [ -n "$SUMMARY" ]; then
  echo "" >> "$1"
  echo "$SUMMARY" >> "$1"
fi
```

---

## CI / GitHub Actions

### Basic: PR impact comments

Copy the included workflow to your repo:

```bash
cp node_modules/@optave/codegraph/.github/workflows/codegraph-impact.yml .github/workflows/
```

Every PR gets a comment:
> **3 functions changed** -> **12 callers affected** across **7 files**

### Advanced: fail on high-impact PRs

Add a threshold check to your CI pipeline:

```yaml
- name: Check impact threshold
  run: |
    npx codegraph build
    IMPACT=$(npx codegraph diff-impact --ref origin/${{ github.base_ref }} --json)
    AFFECTED=$(echo "$IMPACT" | node -e "
      const d = JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin','utf8'));
      console.log(d.summary?.callersAffected || 0)
    ")
    echo "Callers affected: $AFFECTED"
    if [ "$AFFECTED" -gt 100 ]; then
      echo "::error::High impact PR — $AFFECTED callers affected. Requires additional review."
      exit 1
    fi
```

### Caching the graph database

Speed up CI by caching `.codegraph/`:

```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: .codegraph
    key: codegraph-${{ hashFiles('src/**', 'lib/**') }}
    restore-keys: codegraph-
- run: npx codegraph build  # incremental — only re-parses changed files
```

## AI Agent Integration

### MCP server

Start the MCP server so AI assistants can query your graph:

```bash
codegraph mcp
```

The server exposes tools for `query_function`, `file_deps`, `impact_analysis`, `find_cycles`, and `module_map`.

### CLAUDE.md for your project

Add this to your project's `CLAUDE.md` so AI agents know codegraph is available:

```markdown
## Code Navigation

This project uses codegraph. The database is at `.codegraph/graph.db`.

- **Before modifying a function**: `codegraph fn <name> --no-tests`
- **Before modifying a file**: `codegraph deps <file>`
- **To assess PR impact**: `codegraph diff-impact --no-tests`
- **To find entry points**: `codegraph map`
- **To trace breakage**: `codegraph fn-impact <name> --no-tests`

Rebuild after major structural changes: `codegraph build`

### Semantic search

Use `codegraph search` to find functions by intent rather than exact name.
When a single query might miss results, combine multiple angles with `;`:

  codegraph search "validate auth; check token; verify JWT"
  codegraph search "parse config; load settings" --kind function

Multi-query search uses Reciprocal Rank Fusion — functions that rank
highly across several queries surface first. This is especially useful
when you're not sure what naming convention the codebase uses.

When writing multi-queries, use 2-4 sub-queries (2-4 words each) that
attack the problem from different angles. Pick from these strategies:
- **Naming variants**: cover synonyms the author might have used
  ("send email; notify user; deliver message")
- **Abstraction levels**: pair high-level intent with low-level operation
  ("handle payment; charge credit card")
- **Input/output sides**: cover the read half and write half
  ("parse config; apply settings")
- **Domain + technical**: bridge business language and implementation
  ("onboard tenant; create organization; provision workspace")

Use `--kind function` to cut noise. Use `--file <pattern>` to scope.
```

### Claude Code hooks

You can configure [Claude Code hooks](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) to automatically rebuild the graph after file edits:

```json
// .claude/settings.json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "command": "codegraph build --incremental"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This ensures the graph stays fresh as the AI agent modifies files.

## Developer Workflow

### Watch mode during development

Keep the graph updating in the background while you code:

```bash
codegraph watch
```

Changes are picked up incrementally — no manual rebuilds needed.

### Explore before you edit

Before touching a function, check its blast radius:

```bash
codegraph fn myFunction --no-tests      # callers, callees, call chain
codegraph fn-impact myFunction --no-tests  # what breaks if this changes
```

Before touching a file:

```bash
codegraph deps src/utils/auth.ts         # imports and importers
codegraph impact src/utils/auth.ts       # transitive reverse deps
```

### Find circular dependencies early

```bash
codegraph cycles                         # file-level cycles
codegraph cycles --functions             # function-level cycles
```

### Semantic search for discovery

When you're not sure where something lives:

```bash
codegraph search "handle authentication"
codegraph search "parse config file" --min-score 0.4
```

Build embeddings first (one-time):

```bash
codegraph embed                          # ~23 MB model, fast
codegraph embed --model nomic            # ~137 MB, best quality
```

### Multi-query search

When a single query doesn't capture what you're looking for, combine multiple angles with `;`. Results are ranked using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) — functions that score well across multiple queries rise to the top.

Use **2-4 sub-queries**. Each sub-query should attack the problem from a different angle. The framework below covers the four most effective angles — pick 2-3 that fit your situation:

#### 1. Name what it does vs. what it's called

Codebases are inconsistent. The function you want might be called `authenticate`, `checkAuth`, `verifyUser`, or `ensureLoggedIn`. Cover the likely naming variations:

```bash
# You think "validate input" — but the author might have written "sanitize", "check", or "parse"
codegraph search "validate input; sanitize request; check params"

# You think "send email" — but it could be "notify", "mail", or "deliver"
codegraph search "send email; notify user; deliver message"
```

#### 2. Describe the behavior at different abstraction levels

A high-level description ("handle payment") and a low-level one ("charge credit card") often match different but related functions. Combining them surfaces the full chain:

```bash
# High-level intent + low-level implementation
codegraph search "handle payment; charge credit card; create Stripe session"

# Architecture concept + concrete operation
codegraph search "rate limiting; count requests per window; throttle API"
```

#### 3. Cover the input side and the output side

Many operations have a clear "read" half and a "write" half. Querying both surfaces the full pipeline:

```bash
# Reading config + applying config
codegraph search "parse config file; apply settings; load environment"

# Receiving data + transforming data
codegraph search "deserialize JSON payload; map response to model"
```

#### 4. Include the domain term and the technical term

Business logic often uses domain language that differs from the technical implementation. Bridge both:

```bash
# Domain language + implementation pattern
codegraph search "onboard new tenant; create organization; provision workspace"

# User-facing concept + internal mechanism
codegraph search "user permissions; role-based access; check authorization"
```

#### Putting it together

A real-world search typically mixes 2-3 of these angles:

```bash
# Refactoring a caching layer — synonyms + abstraction levels + domain terms
codegraph search "cache invalidation; expire stale entries; TTL cleanup" --kind function

# Finding all auth-related code before a security review
codegraph search "authenticate request; verify JWT; check session token" --file "src/api/*"

# Understanding how errors propagate — input/output + abstraction
codegraph search "catch exception; format error response; report failure to client"
```

**Additional tips:**

- Keep each sub-query to **2-4 words** — embedding models work best on short, focused phrases
- Use `--kind function` or `--kind method` to cut noise from class/type matches
- Use `--file <pattern>` to scope to a directory when you roughly know where the code lives
- Lower `--rrf-k` (e.g., `--rrf-k 30`) to make top-ranked results dominate more sharply

## .gitignore

Add the codegraph database to `.gitignore` — it's a build artifact:

```
# codegraph
.codegraph/
```

The database is rebuilt from source with `codegraph build`. Don't commit it.

## Suggested setup checklist

```bash
# 1. Install codegraph
npm install -g @optave/codegraph

# 2. Build the graph
codegraph build

# 3. Add to .gitignore
echo ".codegraph/" >> .gitignore

# 4. Set up pre-commit hook (with husky)
npm install -D husky
npx husky init
echo "codegraph build" > .husky/pre-commit

# 5. Copy CI workflow
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cp node_modules/@optave/codegraph/.github/workflows/codegraph-impact.yml .github/workflows/

# 6. (Optional) Build embeddings for semantic search
codegraph embed

# 7. (Optional) Add CLAUDE.md for AI agents
# See the AI Agent Integration section above
```

# Codegraph Performance Benchmarks

Self-measured on every release by running codegraph on its own codebase.
Metrics are normalized per file for cross-version comparability.

### Notes

**Benchmark corpus reduction (v3.10.0 745 files → v3.11.0 623 files, –16%):**
Methodology change from PR #1134, which excluded
`tests/benchmarks/resolution/fixtures/**` from the dogfooding `buildGraph`
sweep so heavyweight new grammars (e.g. Verilog #1107) no longer inflate
timing. Per-file metrics (`Build ms/file`, `Query ms`, `Nodes/file`,
`Edges/file`, `DB bytes/file`) remain comparable across versions — they're
normalized by the file count actually measured. Absolute totals in the
"Raw totals (latest)" block (build time, DB size, total nodes/edges) are
scoped to the post-#1134 corpus and are **not** directly comparable to
v3.10.0 absolute totals. The lower file count is expected and intentional.
The corpus grew slightly from 623 (v3.11.0) to 625 (v3.11.1).

**Native 1-file rebuild regression (v3.8.1 42 ms → v3.9.0 562 ms, ↑1238%):** The native incremental
path is re-running graph-wide work on single-file rebuilds. The phase breakdown shows `structureMs`
at 151.7 ms for a 1-file rebuild vs 54.1 ms for the full 567-file build, and `setupMs` at 38.2 ms
vs 5.5 ms. AST/complexity/CFG/dataflow phases also jump from near-zero to 20-28 ms each,
suggesting these phases are not scoped to only the changed file. WASM 1-file rebuild (559 ms) is
superficially similar in total time but has a different root cause: WASM is parse-dominated
(`parseMs` 258.2 ms accounts for nearly half the total) while `structureMs` (28.3 ms),
`astMs`/`cfgMs`/`dataflowMs` (all under 1 ms) are correctly scoped. The native regression is
specifically in graph-wide phases being re-run during incremental builds. The no-op rebuild
(8 ms native, 15 ms WASM) is unaffected, confirming the regression is triggered by actual
file-change detection.

**Engine edge divergence (v3.9.0, 1 edge):** Native reports 30,609 edges and WASM reports 30,610
for the same 567-file codebase (node counts match at 15,483). This is a parity bug — tracked in
#855.

**WASM regression (v2.0.0 → v2.1.0, ↑32% — persists in v2.3.0):** The
"v2.1.0" entry was measured after the v2.1.0 tag on main, when `package.json`
still read "2.1.0" but the codebase already included post-release features:
receiver field extraction (`b08c2b2`) and Commander/Express callback extraction
(`2ac24ef`). Both added WASM-to-JS boundary crossings on every
`call_expression` AST node. The native engine was unaffected because its Rust
extractors have zero boundary overhead — and it gained a net 24% speedup from
the ~45% edge reduction introduced by scoped call-resolution fallback
(`3a11191`). For WASM the extra crossings outweighed the edge savings. A
targeted fix in `d4ef6da` gated `extractCallbackDefinition` behind a
`member_expression` type check and eliminated redundant `childForFieldName`
calls, but the v2.3.0 CI benchmark confirms this was **insufficient** — WASM
remains at 6.6 ms/file (vs 5.0 in v2.0.0). The WASM/Native ratio widened from
2.0x to 3.5x. Further optimization of WASM boundary crossings in the JS
extractor is needed to recover the regression.

**Build regression (v3.1.4 3.5 ms/file → v3.3.0 8 ms/file, +129% native):** The codebase grew from
398 to 429 files (+8%), but the per-file regression is real and driven by richer extraction. Between
v3.1.4 and v3.3.0, type inference was extended to all typed languages (#501), receiver type tracking
with graded confidence was added (#505), re-exported barrel file symbols are now tracked (#515), and
package.json exports + monorepo workspace resolution was introduced (#509). These produce 33% more
nodes/file (13.4 → 17.8) and 28% more edges/file (28.8 → 36.8). The Parse phase tripled on native
(468 → 1511 ms) because extractors now perform additional AST traversals for type annotations and
receiver resolution. The Complexity phase grew 10× (16 → 179 ms) because 33% more functions each
require full AST analysis. Major refactors also decomposed monolithic extractors into per-category
handlers (#490) and split domain/feature modules (#491, #492), adding 31 new source files — the
benchmark measures codegraph on itself, so more source files amplify per-file overhead.

**Native build regression (v3.0.0 4.4 ms/file → v3.0.3 12.3 ms/file):** The regression is entirely
from new build phases added in v3.0.1 that are now default-on: AST node extraction (651ms),
dataflow analysis (367ms), and CFG construction (169ms) — totalling ~1,187ms of new work. The original
seven phases (parse, insert, resolve, edges, structure, roles, complexity) actually got slightly faster
(728ms → 542ms). As of v3.1.0, CFG and dataflow run natively in Rust, eliminating the redundant WASM
pre-parse that previously added ~388ms on native builds.

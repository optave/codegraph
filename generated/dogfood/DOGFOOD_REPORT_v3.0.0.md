# Dogfooding Report: @optave/codegraph@3.0.0

**Date:** 2026-03-03
**Platform:** Windows 11 Pro (10.0.26200), win32-x64, Node v22.18.0
**Native binary:** @optave/codegraph-win32-x64-msvc@3.0.0 (Rust binary reports v2.6.0 internally)
**Active engine:** native (v2.6.0 — see Bug 1)
**Target repo:** codegraph itself (164 files, 2 languages)

---

## 1. Setup & Installation

| Step | Result |
|------|--------|
| `npm install @optave/codegraph@3.0.0` | 142 packages, 3s, 0 vulnerabilities |
| `npx codegraph --version` | 3.0.0 |
| Native binary package | @optave/codegraph-win32-x64-msvc@3.0.0 installed |
| `npx codegraph info` | Native engine available, reports v2.6.0 internally |
| Optional deps pinned | All 4 platform packages pinned to 3.0.0 |

**Issue:** The native binary internally reports version 2.6.0, not 3.0.0. The `Cargo.toml` version was not bumped before the release build. See Bug 1.

---

## 2. Cold Start (Pre-Build)

All 38 commands tested without a graph database present.

| `manifesto` | PASS | "error: unknown command" (removed in v3.0.0) |
| `batch-query` | PASS | "error: unknown command" (removed in v3.0.0) |

**Result:** 38/38 commands handle missing graph gracefully. Zero crashes.

## 4. Rebuild & Staleness

| Test | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Incremental no-op | PASS | "No changes detected. Graph is up to date." Tier 0 skipped, Tier 1 check |
| Touch file (mtime change only) | PASS | Tier 1: 1 need hash check, Tier 2: 0 actually changed. Self-healed mtime. |

| Force full rebuild | PASS | Same counts as incremental (3055/6821) |
| Search after rebuild (no re-embed) | PASS | Results still return correctly |
| Restore file + rebuild | PASS | Detects change, re-parses, counts stable |

---

## 5. Engine Comparison

| Metric | Native | WASM | Delta |
|--------|--------|------|-------|
| Nodes | 3055 | 2966 | +89 (3.0%) |
| Edges | 6821 | 6746 | +75 (1.1%) |
| Roles: core | 436 | 429 | +7 |
| Roles: dead | 2144 | 2058 | +86 |
| AST nodes stored | 24716 | 40612 | -15896 |
| Complexity functions | 939 | 938 | +1 |
| AST node kinds | call only | call + 5 more | See Bug 2 |

**Analysis:** Native extracts ~3% more symbols and edges than WASM. The AST node count difference is notable — WASM stores 40612 (extracting all 6 kinds for JS/TS/TSX via tree walk), while native stores 24716 (calls only). The native engine cannot extract `new`, `string`, `regex`, `throw`, `await` AST nodes because it doesn't preserve the parse tree.

|------|--------|
| `import('@optave/codegraph')` | PASS — 166 exports |
| Key functions present | `buildGraph`, `loadConfig`, `openDb`, `findDbPath`, `contextData`, `explainData`, `whereData`, `statsData`, `isNativeAvailable` — all `function` type |

### Performance Benchmarks

**Not completed.** All 4 benchmark scripts (`benchmark.js`, `incremental-benchmark.js`, `query-benchmark.js`, `embedding-benchmark.js`) require WASM grammars, which cannot be built on this platform due to a wasi-sdk clang crash (LLVM bug in `clang 21.1.4` on Windows with `tree-sitter-javascript` parser). This is a platform-specific issue, not a codegraph bug.

## 8. Bugs Found

### BUG 1: Native engine reports version 2.6.0 (Low) — RESOLVED post-v3.0.0
- **Issue:** [#305](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/issues/305)
- **PR:** [#310](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/310)
- **Symptoms:** `codegraph info` shows "Native version: 2.6.0" when package is v3.0.0. Build metadata shows version mismatch warning.
- **Root cause:** `Cargo.toml` version not bumped to 3.0.0 before release build.
- **Impact:** Cosmetic, but may trigger unnecessary full rebuilds due to version mismatch detection in `buildGraph()`.

> Fixed in commit `8b96f7c` — Cargo.toml version bumped to 3.0.0, CI now includes Cargo.toml in publish version bump commit (#315).

### BUG 2: Native engine only stores 'call' AST nodes (Medium) — RESOLVED post-v3.0.0
- **Issue:** [#306](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/issues/306)
- **PR:** [#314](https://github.com/optave/codegraph/pull/314)
- **Symptoms:** `ast --kind new/string/regex/throw/await` all return "No AST nodes found" when graph built with native engine.
- **Root cause:** Native Rust engine extracts only `call_expression` nodes. It doesn't preserve the parse tree, so the JavaScript-side AST walk in `ast.js` cannot extract the 5 additional node kinds. WASM engine works correctly.
- **Impact:** Users relying on native engine (default) get incomplete AST query results. 24716 nodes stored vs 40612 with WASM for the same codebase.

> Fixed in commit `6101b5e` — native engine now extracts all 6 AST node kinds (call, new, throw, await, string, regex).

---

## 9. Suggestions for Improvement

### 9.1 Default `--cfg` and `--dataflow` on full rebuilds
Currently these are opt-in flags. Users discovering the `cfg` and `dataflow` commands will get empty results unless they know to rebuild with flags. Consider either:
- Making them default (with `--no-cfg`/`--no-dataflow` to opt out)
- Or showing a more prominent hint in the `cfg`/`dataflow` commands

### 9.2 Document AST node kind limitations per engine — RESOLVED post-v3.0.0
The `ast` command help should note that non-call kinds require the WASM engine, or the native engine should be extended for parity.

> Fixed in commit `6101b5e` (#314) — native engine now extracts all 6 AST node kinds, eliminating the parity gap entirely.

### 9.3 Benchmark scripts should handle missing WASM grammars — RESOLVED post-v3.0.0
All 4 benchmark scripts crash if WASM grammars aren't built. They should either:
- Fall back to native-only benchmarking
- Or print a helpful error message instead of crashing

> Fixed in commit `189cefb` (#311) — all 4 benchmark scripts now handle missing WASM grammars gracefully.

### 9.4 `flow --list` should work after build — RESOLVED post-v3.0.0
`flow --list` returns "No entry points found" after a standard build. Entry point classification happens during build (50 entry points detected in roles), but `flow --list` doesn't find them. These may need to be stored explicitly.

> Fixed in commit `6681597` — `flow --list` now includes role-based entry points from the roles classification.

## 10. Testing Plan

### General Testing Plan (Any Release)

- [ ] Install from npm, verify version
- [ ] Verify native binary installs and loads
- [ ] Run all commands without graph — verify graceful errors
- [ ] Build graph, verify node/edge counts
- [ ] Run all query commands with `-T`, `--json`
- [ ] Test edge cases: nonexistent symbols, invalid kinds, empty results
- [ ] Test incremental rebuild: no-op, touch, real change
- [ ] Test embed + search pipeline
- [ ] Test export formats (DOT, Mermaid, JSON, GraphML, GraphSON, Neo4j)
- [ ] Test MCP server (single-repo and multi-repo)
- [ ] Test programmatic API imports
- [ ] Test registry add/remove/prune
- [ ] Test snapshot save/list/restore/delete
- [ ] Compare native vs WASM engine outputs
- [ ] Run benchmarks (if WASM grammars available)

### Release-Specific Testing Plan (v3.0.0)

- [x] Verify all 5 removed commands error ("unknown command")
- [x] Test `dataflow` command with `--dataflow` build flag
- [x] Test `cfg` command with `--cfg` build flag

- [x] Verify `normalizeSymbol` consistency in JSON output
- [ ] Test `build --dataflow --cfg` incremental behavior
- [ ] Test `path <from> <to>` standalone command (was `query --path`)

### Proposed Additional Tests

- Test concurrent builds (two builds at once)
- Test `.codegraphrc.json` config: include/exclude, aliases, build.incremental
- Test env var overrides: `CODEGRAPH_LLM_PROVIDER`, `CODEGRAPH_REGISTRY_PATH`
- Test `apiKeyCommand` credential resolution
- Test on a non-codegraph repository (e.g., small OSS project)
- Test database schema migration (v2.x graph.db → v3.0.0)
- Test embed → modify → rebuild → search pipeline for stale embeddings

## 11. Overall Assessment

Codegraph v3.0.0 is a substantial release that delivers on its three headline features: dataflow analysis, intraprocedural CFG, and stored AST nodes. The CLI surface consolidation (removing 5 commands) is clean — all removed commands error gracefully. The new export formats (GraphML, GraphSON, Neo4j CSV) and interactive HTML viewer work well. Search with hybrid BM25+semantic ranking is excellent.

The two bugs found are both related to native engine parity:
1. Version reporting is cosmetic but confusing
2. AST node kind coverage is a real feature gap affecting users who rely on non-call AST queries

Cold start handling is perfect (38/38 commands graceful). Incremental builds are solid with three-tier change detection. The MCP server exposes 30/31 tools correctly in single/multi-repo modes. The programmatic API exports 166 functions/constants.

Areas that could use attention: the opt-in nature of `--cfg` and `--dataflow` may surprise users, benchmark scripts don't handle missing WASM grammars, and `flow --list` doesn't find entry points after a standard build.

**Rating: 8/10**

Justification: Solid feature delivery with comprehensive CLI and MCP coverage. The native engine parity gap on AST nodes is the most significant issue. The version mismatch is minor but should be fixed. The release is production-ready for most workflows, with the caveat that full AST querying requires `--engine wasm`.

## 2. Cold Start (Pre-Build)

Tested all commands against a fresh project with no `.codegraph/graph.db`.

| Command Category | Status | Notes |
|-----------------|--------|-------|
| Query commands (`query`, `map`, `stats`, `deps`, `impact`, `fn-impact`, `context`, `audit`, `where`) | PASS | DB_ERROR with clear message |
| Analysis commands (`diff-impact`, `cycles`, `structure`, `triage`, `roles`, `complexity`) | PASS | DB_ERROR with clear message |
| Graph commands (`export`, `cfg`, `dataflow`, `flow`, `co-change`, `communities`) | PASS | DB_ERROR with clear message |
| Navigation commands (`ast`, `sequence`, `implementations`, `interfaces`, `children`, `brief`, `path`) | PASS | DB_ERROR with clear message |
| CI/Misc (`check`, `plot`, `batch`, `branch-compare`, `exports`) | PASS | DB_ERROR with clear message |

## 4. Rebuild & Staleness

### Incremental Rebuilds

| Test | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| No-op rebuild (no changes) | PASS | "No changes detected. Graph is up to date." — 17ms |
| Rebuild with dirty working tree | PASS | Re-parsed changed files, counts consistent |
| Force full rebuild (`--no-incremental`) | PASS | Same counts as incremental (13741/26835) |
| Incremental after full | PASS | Detects no changes, skips |

### Embed-Rebuild-Search Pipeline

| Step | Result |
|------|--------|
| Embed → search | PASS — top result: `buildDependencyGraph` (73.1%) |
| Embed → incremental build → search | PASS — results preserved |
| Full rebuild → search | Embeddings cleared — "No embeddings found" (expected) |
| Embed → rebuild → no-op build → search | PASS — embeddings and results stable |

### Dataflow Recovery

The initial native build (from source repo v3.6.0 code) failed to insert dataflow edges due to `paramIndex: null` → napi-rs `u32` conversion error. A subsequent incremental build automatically ran a "pending analysis pass" that inserted 8263 dataflow edges via the JS fallback. The published v3.8.1 package has this fix (PR #788: `null` → `undefined`).

## 5. Engine Comparison

### Build Results (Source Repo JS Pipeline)

When running from the source repo (v3.6.0 code, JS pipeline with native parsing):

| Metric | Native | WASM | Delta |
|--------|--------|------|-------|
| Nodes | 13,741 | 13,741 | 0 |
| Edges | 26,835 | 26,837 | **-2** |
| Calls | 5,458 | 5,460 | -2 |
| dynamic-imports | 137 | 138 | -1 |
| receiver | 582 | 581 | +1 |
| Quality score | 68 | 65 | +3 |
| Call confidence | 85.9% | 78.5% | +7.4% |
| Complexity analyzed | 2,718 | 2,716 | +2 |
| maxCyclomatic | 60 | 43 | **+17** |
| minMI | 13.4 | 21.2 | **-7.8** |

Edge parity is near-perfect (2-edge gap, 0.007%). Complexity metrics diverge more significantly.

### Build Results (Published v3.8.1 Package, Native Orchestrator)

When running from the published npm package with full native orchestrator:

| Metric | Native Orch. | WASM | Delta |
|--------|-------------|------|-------|
| Nodes | 13,672 | 13,741 | **-69** |
| Edges | 23,466 | 26,837 | **-3,371** |
| calls | 4,375 | 5,460 | **-1,085** |
| imports | 21 | 1,202 | **-1,181** |
| dynamic-imports | 1 | 138 | **-137** |
| contains | 13,139 | 13,734 | **-595** |
| reexports | 5 | 135 | **-130** |
| Quality score | 63 | 65 | -2 |

**Critical: The native build orchestrator (v3.8.0+) drops 12.6% of edges, primarily imports (98% missing) and calls (20% missing).** This was identified in the v3.8.0 dogfood report and persists in v3.8.1 with slight improvement. See issue #804.

### Per-Query Comparison

Queries tested with both engines (source repo JS pipeline, near-identical graphs):

| Query | Native | WASM | Match? |
|-------|--------|------|--------|
| `fn-impact buildGraph` | 4 dependents | 4 dependents | Yes |
| `cycles` | 1 file, 5 function | 1 file, 5 function | Yes |
| `stats --json` | See table above | See table above | Partial (complexity differs) |

## 9. Bugs Found

### BUG 1: Native build orchestrator drops 12.6% of edges (Critical)

- **Issue:** [#804](https://github.com/optave/ops-codegraph-tool/issues/804)
- **PR:** Open — too complex for this session (requires Rust orchestrator changes)
- **Symptoms:** Published v3.8.1 package with `--engine native` produces 23,466 edges vs 26,837 with WASM. Import edges nearly all missing (21 vs 1,202), ~1,085 call edges missing, directory nodes missing.
- **Root cause:** Native Rust build orchestrator (PR #740, v3.8.0) has incomplete import resolution and edge building compared to JS pipeline.
- **Impact:** Users on `--engine native` (default) get degraded graph with incomplete import edges. The JS pipeline fallback (used when source repo code is older than the addon) produces correct results.
- **Note:** Known since v3.8.0 dogfood, slightly improved in v3.8.1 but still significant.

### BUG 2: Native vs WASM edge parity gap (2 edges) (Low)

- **Issue:** [#802](https://github.com/optave/ops-codegraph-tool/issues/802)
- **Symptoms:** When using JS pipeline with native parsing (avoiding the orchestrator), native produces 2 fewer call edges, 1 fewer dynamic-import, 1 more receiver edge.
- **Root cause:** Minor edge attribution differences in native parser.

### BUG 3: Native vs WASM complexity metric divergence (Low)

- **Issue:** [#803](https://github.com/optave/ops-codegraph-tool/issues/803)
- **Symptoms:** Native: maxCyclomatic=60, minMI=13.4. WASM: maxCyclomatic=43, minMI=21.2. Native analyzes 2 more functions.
- **Root cause:** Native engine extracts more control-flow nodes or handles certain AST patterns differently.

### Previously Filed (Closed)

- **#801** (dataflow paramIndex null): Closed — fix present in published v3.8.1, error only in local v3.6.0 source code.

## 10. Suggestions for Improvement

### 10.1 Fix or disable the native build orchestrator

The orchestrator drops 12.6% of edges. Until fixed, consider defaulting `--engine auto` to use the JS pipeline (with native parsing) rather than the full native orchestrator. This preserves the 2x build speed advantage of native parsing while ensuring correct edge counts.

### 10.2 Auto-install fallback on Windows

The `@huggingface/transformers` auto-install fails on Windows with `spawnSync npm ENOENT` because `npm` isn't resolved in the PATH when using `spawnSync` without shell. Consider using `execSync` with shell: true, or provide a clearer error message suggesting manual install.

### 10.3 Update SKILL.md MCP tool counts

The dogfood SKILL.md references 32/33 MCP tools but the actual count is 34/35. Update to match.

### 10.4 Add `--db` support to `branch-compare` and `info`

These commands don't support `--db`, requiring users to run from within the project directory. Adding `--db` would improve ergonomics for CI and scripting.

## 11. Testing Plan

### General Testing Plan (Any Release)

- [ ] Install from npm, verify version and native binary
- [ ] Cold start: all commands fail gracefully without graph
- [ ] Build with both engines, compare node/edge counts
- [ ] Verify incremental no-op, 1-file, and full rebuilds
- [ ] Embed → rebuild → search pipeline
- [ ] All query commands with `-T`, `--json`, `--depth` flags
- [ ] Edge cases: non-existent symbols, files, invalid kinds
- [ ] MCP server: single-repo and multi-repo tool counts
- [ ] Programmatic API: ESM and CJS imports
- [ ] Config: `.codegraphrc.json` overrides applied
- [ ] Registry: add/list/remove/prune
- [ ] Snapshot: save/list/restore
- [ ] Run all 4 benchmarks, compare to previous release
- [ ] `--no-tests` effect on result counts

### Release-Specific Testing Plan (v3.8.1)

- [ ] Windows polling watcher: `--poll` flag present, default on Windows
- [ ] Embed absolute path fix: embeddings work with native engine paths
- [ ] dataflow paramIndex: `null` → `undefined` fix in published package
- [ ] Build_meta preserved through native finalize phase
- [ ] Import-edge skip scoped to Windows only
- [ ] Cycle/stats optimization: no regression in output
- [ ] Native query analysis routing works
- [ ] Duplicate function defs in Leiden fixed

### Proposed Additional Tests

- [ ] **Watch mode lifecycle:** Start watcher, modify file, verify incremental update, Ctrl+C graceful shutdown
- [ ] **Concurrent builds:** Two build processes simultaneously — verify no DB corruption
- [ ] **Different repo:** Test on a non-TypeScript project (e.g., a Go or Python repo)
- [ ] **Database migration:** Test with a graph.db from v3.0.0 → v3.8.1
- [ ] **`apiKeyCommand` credential resolution:** Test with `echo` command
- [ ] **Env var overrides:** `CODEGRAPH_LLM_PROVIDER`, `CODEGRAPH_REGISTRY_PATH`
- [ ] **Symbol kind filter:** Test `--kind` with all 10 valid kinds
- [ ] **Export formats:** Test `-f graphml`, `-f neo4j`, `-f graphson`
- [ ] **False positive filtering:** Verify `FALSE_POSITIVE_NAMES` in stats output

---

## 12. Overall Assessment

v3.8.1 is a solid stabilization release with important Windows fixes (polling watcher, import-edge scoping) and performance improvements (query analysis through native, cycle/stats optimization). The CLI is mature — all 41 commands handle edge cases gracefully, embeddings and search work well, and the MCP server correctly exposes 34/35 tools.

The **critical remaining issue** is the native build orchestrator (introduced v3.8.0), which still drops ~12.6% of edges, primarily import edges. This means users on the default `--engine auto` path get incomplete graphs when the orchestrator activates. The JS pipeline fallback produces correct results, so users can work around this with `--engine wasm` or by running from source code older than v3.8.0.

Build performance is excellent: 2x native speedup, 17ms no-op rebuilds, sub-10ms queries. No performance regressions detected vs v3.8.0.

**Rating: 6.5/10** — The CLI is feature-complete and stable, but the native orchestrator edge gap is a significant correctness issue that affects the default user path. All other tested functionality works correctly.

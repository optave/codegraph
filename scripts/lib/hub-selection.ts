/**
 * Deterministic hub/mid/leaf target selection for benchmark scripts.
 *
 * `query-benchmark.ts` and `benchmark.ts` each pick representative call-graph
 * nodes ("hub" = well-connected, "mid"/"leaf" = less connected) by `name` to
 * drive their timed queries. Both independently duplicated a `selectTargets`
 * query that filtered candidates by file path (`NOT LIKE '%test%'`/`'%spec%'`)
 * but not by `kind` — so a hub-candidate name like `buildGraph` could resolve
 * to a local `const { buildGraph } = await import(...)` binding (`kind =
 * 'constant'`) instead of the real `function buildGraph` definition, and
 * which node won depended on unspecified SQLite row order (#1904).
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for that selection: it filters
 * to `HUB_CANDIDATE_KINDS` (mirroring `CALLABLE_SYMBOL_KINDS` in
 * `src/shared/kinds.ts`, #1888 — the same "same-name lookup with no other
 * signal" hazard) and adds an explicit `ORDER BY id` tie-break so the choice
 * is reproducible across builds that insert the same logical nodes in a
 * different physical row order (e.g. worker-thread parse completion order).
 *
 * Callers that need to act on the resolved hub's file (e.g. `benchDiffImpact`
 * writing a probe comment into it) should use the `hubFile` this returns
 * instead of re-querying `nodes` by name — a second unfiltered query can
 * disagree with this one about which physical node "the hub" is.

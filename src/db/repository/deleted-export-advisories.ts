/**
 * Deleted-export advisories — a durable, purge-order-independent record of
 * exported function/method/class definitions lost when a file is deleted in
 * its entirety, for deletions whose exports still have an external
 * consumer at the moment the file is removed.
 *
 * `checkNoDeletedExportsInUse` (features/check.ts) can only see this via a
 * live query while the deleted file's `nodes`/`edges` rows still exist in
 * the DB. Those rows are purged by the very next `codegraph build`
 * (`detectChanges` stage) regardless of whether `codegraph check` has run
 * yet — `check` never triggers a rebuild itself, so whether it can still see
 * a deleted file's exports depends entirely on external orchestration
 * ordering. This module lets the build pipeline snapshot the pre-purge
 * state into a durable table, at the exact point `detectChanges` computes
 * the removed-file set, so `check` can fall back to it once the live rows
 * are gone. See issue #1938.

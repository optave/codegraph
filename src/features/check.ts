/**
 * Detects exported functions/methods/classes lost when a file is deleted in
 * its entirety, for deletions whose exports still have consumers elsewhere
 * in the codebase.
 *
 * `checkNoSignatureChanges` can never see this case: a fully deleted file
 * never gets a `changedRanges` entry (there is no new-side content to track
 * — see `parseDiffOutput`'s `+++ /dev/null` handling), and its `nodes` rows
 * are purged by the very next `codegraph build`/incremental rebuild
 * (`DELETE FROM nodes WHERE file = ?`, run unconditionally for any file
 * `detectChanges` no longer finds on disk — see
 * `domain/graph/builder/stages/detect-changes.ts`). `checkData` itself never
 * triggers a rebuild — it only opens the DB read-only — so whether this
 * predicate can see a deleted file's exports depends entirely on whether
 * some *other*, separate `codegraph build` invocation has already purged it
 * by the time `check` runs.
 *
 * For a file whose `nodes` rows are still live (no rebuild has purged it
 * yet), this queries them directly. Once a rebuild purges them, it falls
 * back to `deleted_export_advisories` — a durable snapshot the build
 * pipeline captures at the exact point it computes the removed-file set,
 * BEFORE purging (see `recordDeletedExportAdvisories` /
 * `db/repository/deleted-export-advisories.ts`) — so the violation stays
 * visible regardless of build/check invocation order (#1938).
 *
 * Unlike `checkNoSignatureChanges` (which flags any touched exported
 * declaration regardless of caller count, since editing an exported line is
 * inherently risky), this predicate only flags a deleted export when it has
 * a real consumer OUTSIDE the deleted file — reusing the same
 * cross-file-consumer shape as `domain/analysis/exports.ts` /
 * `features/structure.ts` (`calls`/`imports-type` edges whose source file
 * differs from the target's file). Deleting a file whose exports are never
 * imported elsewhere is a legitimate, safe cleanup and must not be flagged.
 *
 * Known limitation: a same-commit rename (delete `old.js` + add `new.js`
 * with equivalent exports, with callers updated to import from `new.js` in
 * the same diff) can false-positive here, because `db` only reflects
 * pre-change edges — it has no visibility into the staged content of the
 * files that will import from the new location. This mirrors an existing,
 * accepted trade-off in this predicate family (e.g. `checkMaxBlastRadius`'s
 * paren-less-call blind spot) rather than a new class of problem.
